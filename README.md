*My personal website. There are many like it, but this was mine (2011-2015).*

Originallly managed by [Movable Type](https://movabletype.org), this repo contains all the source files required to build the site using that software. Originally served using PHP, the files in `www` have been rebuilt so they can be served as static HTML.
