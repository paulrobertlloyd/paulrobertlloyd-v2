cwhomes.co.uk is a property portal that brings together the combined resources of over sixty independent estate agency offices within Coventry and Warwickshire.

Working with server-side developer Andrew Ayriss, I gave the existing site a vibrant and contemporary update, and developed a standards based front-end code base that would be more performant and easier to maintain.
