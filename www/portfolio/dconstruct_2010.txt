Presented by Clearleft, dConstruct is a grassroots conference held annually in Brighton. Speakers at the 2010 edition were invited to explore the power of design thinking.

A conference is only as good as its content, so the homepage featured prominent images of those speaking at the event. The design referred back to an original dConstruct brand asset--the opened cube net--which was placed in different positions across the site to effect the layout of each page.
