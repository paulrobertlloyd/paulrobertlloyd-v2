Jim Smith (<abbr title="also known as">aka</abbr> [Waldo Pancake][1]) is a designer, illustrator and copywriter whose work can be found on the side of juice bottles, sweet packets and inside every [Puccino's][2] coffee shop.

His existing site used a Flash-based solution, but this meant his work couldn't be viewed on mobile devices. Wanting to maintain similar slideshow functionality (with images that could be updated via an <abbr title="File Transfer Protocol">FTP</abbr> client) Jim approached me to redevelop his website. In addition to visualising his designs in <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, I created a simple file based content management system in <abbr title="PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</abbr> and utilised jQuery to provide cross-browser compatible image slideshows.
