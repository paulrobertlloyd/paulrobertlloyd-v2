The Week magazine condenses the news into lively and informative editorial, giving readers an insight into the week's most vital stories. With over 183,000 subscribers, it's also the <abbr>UK</abbr>'s most popular weekly subscription magazine. Part of this success can be attributed to a rigorously consistent editorial format which readers describe as familiar, reliable and intuitive.

Myself and [Harry Brignull][1] were tasked with bringing this much loved publication to a new generation of tablet users; retaining the best qualities of the print edition whilst also creating a product true to the best abilities of the iPad.

With a readership not looking for rich interactivity, embedded videos or masses of hyperlinks, we focused instead on creating an easy to navigate interface that privileged the reading experience. A highly iterative approach saw the design evolve over the course of the project; working first with paper sketches, then click-through keynote prototypes before finessing the design in Fireworks; all whilst using real content from the magazine to ensure what we were designing would actually work!

Working closely with the development team at [Kaldor][2], we then honed the gestural interface, navigation and page templates. Building upon their hybrid [PugPig][3] framework, the application could take advantage of native iOS features and also utilise <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> for precise layout and typographic control for each article.

Features include an archive of back-issues, adjustable text size, a night reading mode and automatic downloading through Apple's iOS5 Newsstand. [It's available now on the App Store][4].
