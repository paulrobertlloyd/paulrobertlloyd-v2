Presented by Clearleft, dConstruct is a grassroots conference held annually in Brighton. Speakers at the 2011 edition were invited to explore how we can bridge the gap between physical and digital product design.

A conference is only as good as its speakers, so like [the previous year's design][1], the homepage featured prominent images of those speaking at the event. The design process involved close collaboration with [Andy Hume][2], which was needed for us to build a highly responsive website that would work well across devices. With this in mind, the main navigation was simplified to just four items (Conference, Workshops, Location and Register) and an alternative navigation method was shown when browsing speaker pages on smaller screens.
