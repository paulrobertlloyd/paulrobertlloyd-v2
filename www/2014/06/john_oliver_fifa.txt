John Oliver's new weekly late-night HBO show <cite>[Last Week Tonight][1]</cite> has seen him deliver a number of cutting satirical observations on current events. His [thoughts on net neutrality][2] perfectly encapsulated the blatant corruption surrounding the FCC's proposed regulatory changes. But on the eve of the World Cup, his comments on FIFA are worth sharing:

> [Football] is an organised religion, and FIFA is its church. Just think about it, its leader is infallible, it compels South American countries to spend money they don't have building opulent cathedrals, and it may ultimately be responsible for the deaths of shocking numbers of people in the Middle East. But, for millions of people around the world like me, it is also the guardian of the only thing that gives their lives any meaning.

Spot on.
