As the weeks slowly become normal again, so it is that every other Sunday night, a group of amazingly talented people come together and perform a wide range of material--from covers to their own compositions--during an acoustic night held at the Boundary Hotel in Walsall.

Usually playing are [Jon][1], Dave and Pat, Dan on occasion, and this week Paul too. Add these to a list of regulars that includes Pete and Foz (amongst many others) and it really is a great end to the weekend.

Anyway, not of brilliant quality, but interesting all the same, I present this video of Jon and Dave performing 'Swim for Me'--one of their own which ain't half bad! Seeing as it was taken on a swanky new camera phone, it requires a media player capable of playing <abbr>MPEG4</abbr>-<abbr>3GP</abbr> files.
