As I'm getting older, I'm noticing that I am able to perform more of those certain little tricks that were missing throughout my childhood.

A year or so ago I finally found I was able to whistle (well okay, it's more of a shrill but a sound none the less), and more recently I have been to click my fingers (although on my right hand only). Add to this the fact that I can now swim under water with my eyes open, and it gets me wondering.

If I was to extrapolate this increasing skill level, surely it would work out that I should have x-ray vision by the age of 68--which at that age could come in very useful.
