It's been quite while since I last ran for charity (in fact [my last run][1] was way back in 2006), so in the vein hope that the training will help me get a little fitter, I'm taking part in this years [Great South Run][2] in Portsmouth, and aiming to raise ï¿½400 for Cancer Research <abbr>UK</abbr>.

I was originally planing on doing the Great North Run, a race I've enjoyed many times before, however the logistics and expenses involved in travelling to Newcastle from the south coast meant I needed to find an alternative. Luckily the Great South Run is far closer to home, and thankfully has a running distance that is 3 miles shorter!

Once again I'm collecting sponsorship on-line with Just Giving, so [please visit my sponsorship page][3] and give as much as you can. Thank-you.
