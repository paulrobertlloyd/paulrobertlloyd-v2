On Monday evening I took the plunge and made my debut speaking engagement at the 20&#215;2 event at <abbr title="South by Southwest">SXSW</abbr>. Luckily it all came together at the last minute (and I mean last minute) and wasn't too embarrassing.

For those that weren't there, here it is:

Overall, I think I pulled it out of the bag. It turned out to be bit of a promotion for Ning and the <abbr title="United States">US</abbr>, and the fact that the lyrics of the song '...where I belong...' coincided with the many (many) pictures of Las Vegas--a place not top of my list of favourite cities--and certainly wasn't planned.

Had I come up with this What If... a week earlier (instead of spending an entire week trying to answer the question 'What if the Web Was Invented 10 Years Earlier', which turned out to be a minefield) it may have been as good as the video that followed it. Created by [Glenda Bautista][1], it's answer was very similar to mine, but far more polished.

[Khoi Vinh][2]'s was probably the one I enjoyed the most: [What If... We Could Eat Online][3]. Having said that, all the presentations were excellent, and I loved the variety of answers the question generated.

Finally, a big thank-you to Kevin Newsum and his team. The event was fantastically well put together, and aside from the nerves, thoroughly enjoyable.
