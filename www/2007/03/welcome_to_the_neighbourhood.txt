Yesterday I moved into my new apartment in the Potrero Hill district of San Francisco.

In the morning I went on a walk on and around nearby Third Street, and thanks to my new flatmate Tom whose camera I borrowed, I think I managed to capture just some of the inspiring scenery to be found here. In fact I've only just scratched the surface, as this place is full of photographic opportunity.

I've also just found a nifty little shortcut in iPhoto, that allows you to quickly and easily play around with a photos colour balance. It works by just Apple-clicking on any portion of an image--suddenly I feel like I can have some more fun with my photos!

Anyway, I think this change of scenery is really starting to get my creative juices flowing again, and hopefully it's starting to show!
