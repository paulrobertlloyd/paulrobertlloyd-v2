My British Radar
================

Recently, I've been feeling in a slightly uncomfortable place, a situation in which I feel the continual longing to return home, yet at the same time, the desire to actually live in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> diminishing. In fact I'm almost reaching a point where I feel embarrassed to be British.

Friday night's Klaxons concert provided a perfect example as to why.

Half way through the evening, me and Fabricio found ourselves talking to a Norwegian student who was there with a large group of her friends. One of her English friends, who was trying to work out if this other guy was from the <abbr>UK</abbr>, came up to her and excitedly said:

  > ...he is, he is, I told you! I have a British radar!

However I had already worked this out minutes earlier, and without having spoken to him.

The simple fact is, that to have a 'British radar' is simply to look for a group of loud, slightly over-weight idiots, full of self-importance and zealous pride, who collectively act like a bunch of morons. The same of which could be said of The Klaxons, who were a massive disappointment.

I realised I had this deductibility when I was in Las Vegas earlier this year. Upon spotting a group of guys celebrating a stag party half way down the street, I got the sudden and horrible feeling we were linked by a shared nationality. As they passed, their Liverpudlian accents confirmed my worst fears.

At this point I feel I should add that there is probably a certain age bracket for which the radar works most precisely. I should also mention other indicators include haircuts that can only be explained by a trip to Toni & Guy, and a dress sense that involves wearing clothes that look like they have been eaten by the dog.

But hang on. Loud, slightly over-weight, full of self-importance and a zealous pride? I'm sure the same could equally be said of myself.

When I spend most of my day at the office correcting my colleagues for the use of 'zee' over 'zed', omitting 'u' from colour, as well as practically volunteering myself as a spokesman for the British Tourist Board, I'm sure they would agree.

There is no denying that all I find myself disliking about the British, the problem is, *I am British*, and so I too display the same trademarks.

I guess put more simply, the fact is now that I'm further removed from my place of birth, the more of it I see that I don't like. Yet at the same time, like a mother whose son has grown up to become a career criminal, an unequivocal love remains.
