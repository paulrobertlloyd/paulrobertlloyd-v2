It looks like my blog has been a little undernourished these last few months, but thanks to being tagged in a meme, I have an excuse to at least post something for the month of September.

## The Rules

  * You have to post these rules before giving you the facts.
  * Players state eight random facts/habits about themselves.
  * At the end of the blog post, you tag eight people and list their names. Don't forget to leave them a comment telling them they're tagged, and to read your blog.
  * People who are tagged need to write about their eight things on their own blog and also post these rules.

## The Facts

  1. The back of my head has appeared on childrens television news programme [Newsround][1], when they covered some sort of school based general election they did one year. I also got to meet [Paul Welsh][2]--which is about as exciting as it sounds.

  2.  I only ever seem to meet celebrities that have presented motoring related television programmes. So far that has included [Quentin Wilson][3], [Tony Mason][4], and on the plane to Frankfurt earlier this month, [Mike Brewer][5].

  3. For a long period of my childhood, I was convinced that I had won a competition on [Blue Peter][6] to win a robot, only to have been sent a letter saying it was given to a disabled child that appeared on the show that week. Turns out it was an incredibly vivid dream, but I'm disappointed I didn't get the robot all the same.

  4. When travelling abroad, or indeed whilst living here in the States, I'm often asked if I'm Australian. I was even asked that by a taxi driver--in Australia! Needless to say, the cockney/brummy melting pot that is my accent surely has something to do with it.

  5. My parents owned a dog that stared in a television advert for a Clairol Foot Spa in the early 1980's, and also in print campaigns for Epson photocopiers. I'm told it got a bit much when he demanded his own trailer.

  6. I'm notoriously bad at parking. The worst incident was when I tried to reverse park my car in a Tesco's car park. After trying for 5 minutes I gave up, only for a man in a Mercedes follow me and successfully accomplish the same manoeuvre. One of the passengers in my car then told me that he had serviced that mans car, and that he only had one leg. Shameful.

  7. Since owning a mobile phone, I have kept the same telephone number (not counting the inclusion of the 7 as part of the [Big Number Change][7] exercise). I'm surprisingly proud of this fact. Whilst it wasn't always an easy thing to do, it is today and so annoys me incredibly when others change their numbers when they get a new phone (and then wonder why nobody calls them).

  8. I still have all of my own teeth, with no fillings. Strictly speaking, a few teeth are missing thanks to an overzealous dentist, but not that you can tell.

## Whose Next?

That was actually quite a hard list to compile, which is a little worrying. Anyway, as by way of this meme, here are the eight people I nominate to do the same:

  * [Jon Roobottom](http://www.roobottom.com/)
  * [Lewis Burden](http://www.darthlawb.co.uk/lawblog)
  * [Simon Jobling](http://www.simonjobling.com/)
  * [Trevor Morris](http://www.trovster.com/)
  * [Gareth Brown](http://www.flashdesign.co.uk/)
  * [Andy Higgs](http://andyhiggs.co.uk/blog/2007/09/24/8-random-things)
  * [Krystyn Heide](http://www.krystynheide.com/blog/)
  * [Jon Aquino](http://jonaquino.blogspot.com/)
