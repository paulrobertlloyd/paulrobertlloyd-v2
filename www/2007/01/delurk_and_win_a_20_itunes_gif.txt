My Feedburner stats tell me I have around 50 subscribers to my feed. My site stats suggest that I get a fair few unique visitors to this site everyday. However I don't see that many comments on my posts to justify these numbers.

In the same vein as [Veerle][1] and [Roger][2], I think it's time to 'de-lurk'! If you haven't heard about de-lurking, it's the idea that once a year, you give those visitors to your site that perhaps only read your posts and articles but don't leave comments, the opportunity to do so on one post.

So please, don't be shy! Leave a comment on this post, even if it's just to say hello! I would love to get to know some of my readers better, so why not tell me who you are, where you're from, and perhaps what you like/dislike about this little corner of the web.

## Quote Me Happy

To make things a bit more fun, I want to combine this with a little competition. It could very well be a massive disaster but let's see.

You may have noticed that the title-bar text of my home page currently contains the following quote:

  > The top is a very lonely place to be. Gravity doesn't help either...

I love this little piece of wisdom, although I forget where I found it. Anyway, I'm sure there's a lot more little gems like this out there, and I'd like to update the home page with a new one, and I'd like you to tell me what you think it should be.

It could be a favourite of yours (famous, or not so famous) or you can even make up one of your own if you like. Here's a few others I like, to get the ball rolling:

  > It's a small world, but I wouldn't want to paint it

  > If a man speaks in the forest and there is no woman to hear him, is he still wrong?

  > Life is just something that happens while you're planning other things

The winning entry will win a �20 iTunes Gift Certificate (or $40 card for my American friends). To enter, just suggest a quote in your de-lurking comment below.

The closing date for entries is January 31st 2007 and of course, my decision is final. Good luck!
