Last month I decided to do a little bit of de-lurking, and as part of that I also ran a little contest alongside it. I asked those readers to give me their favourite quote--be it their own or one they've heard.

The de-lurking was a great success. Only 12 comments, but I was after quality not quantity, and as a result found out about a few people who read the site that I didn't know existed prior to the post. Thanks to everybody who took part, I'll definitely be doing this again next year!

Anyway to the competition. Of the nine quotes submitted, I picked the following five finalists:

  1. "Fuck it, dude. Let's go bowling" (Kate Bowlin)
  2. "Anybody can be good in the country. There are no temptations there" (Andrew Rickmann)
  3. "A little nonsense, now and then, is relished by the wisest men" (David Hamilton)
  4. "Life is not a rehearsal--this is it!" (Ian G)
  5. "If you've never seen an elephant ski, you've never been on acid" (Krystyn)

Just for fun, I thought I would pick the winner in the proper manner, and so all five finalists quotes were written onto Post-it Notes, screwed up, and then placed into a hat (you can [see the photos here][1]. I then picked the winner. So without much further ado, drum-roll please... The winning quote is this by Willy Wonka:

  > A little nonsense, now and then, is relished by the wisest men.

Congratulations to **David Hamilton** (who is a fellow web-developer I met at @media last year). You should have received your ï¿½20 iTunes voucher in your e-mail inbox today. I would love to hear what you decided to buy with it, although if it includes anything by Lady Sovereign, I reserve the right to demand my money back!
