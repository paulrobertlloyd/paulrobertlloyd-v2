Today we launched onto an unassuming world, the full glory of an all new Ning. I want to go into some more detail, especially from a personal perspective, as what this new product means to me, and talk about my feeling towards it (in short, I couldn't be prouder). But given it's 4<abbr>am</abbr>, that will have to wait until tomorrow.

In the meantime, sit back relax, and watch Gina and Marc give a little background as to what Ning has just released, courtesy of Scoble.
