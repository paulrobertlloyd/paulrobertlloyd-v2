                <p>The tail end of this year has been <a href="http://paulrobertlloyd.com/2013/10/moving_in_moving_on/">rather hectic</a>. If moving house and changing jobs weren&#8217;t enough to be getting on with, I was also busy redesigning <em><a href="http://24ways.org/">24 ways</a></em>.</p>
                
                <p>For the uninitiated, <em>24 ways</em> is an annual advent calendar for web designers and developers. Published by Drew McLellan since 2005, the site boasts hundreds of articles that impart wisdom and teach new skills.</p>
                
                <p>Following <a href="http://allinthehead.com/retro/366/rebuilding-24-ways">Drew&#8217;s post</a> on how he rebuilt the site, I thought I would describe the process behind the accompanying redesign.</p>
                
                <h2>The brief</h2>
                
                <p>The last major redesign was produced by Tim Van Damme in 2007. His innovative design pushed the limits of the medium &#8211; notably in its use of <abbr title="Red green blue alpha">RGBA</abbr> <abbr>CSS</abbr> colour properties &#8211; and set expectations for any redesign that would follow.</p>
                
                <p>Few designs remain timeless, and after six years it was showing its age. Approaching a ninth season, <a href="http://24ways.org/archive/">the archive</a> was struggling to accommodate more than 200 articles; navigation was breaking down and it had become difficult to explore the range of topics covered.</p>
                
                <p>The design was also failing to reflect the best practices now being promoted. For example, when Geri Coady wrote about <a href="http://24ways.org/2012/colour-accessibility/">colour contrast</a>, her words were presented as grey text on a grey background. The site was responsive (thanks to some retroactive hacking) but a fresh approach was needed to effectively deliver content to a broadening range of devices accessing the site.</p>
                
                <h2>Approach</h2>
                
                <p>Beyond these considerations, I was given free rein.</p>
                
                <p>Red has long been the site&#8217;s signature colour, so while this would be retained, I was keen to explore how other colours could be chosen algorithmically. Since articles feature few images &#8211; most are screenshots or diagrams &#8211; a heavily typographic, European-flavoured approach was mooted. Although the underlying IA was sound, the addition of topics would improve the discoverability of content.</p>
                
                <p>Still, how could this redesign continue the tradition of pushing against the edges of the medium?</p>
                
                <p>In <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/the-web-aesthetic">The Web Aesthetic</a>, I urged designers to move beyond traditional print-inspired layouts, and instead look more to digital software &#8211; all while being true to the universal nature of the medium. Could this be an opportunity to make those ideas real?</p>

                <p>Given the brief in June, every time I sat down to work on the project, I couldn&#8217;t get started. A breakthrough came when I thought back to something <a href="http://danielmall.com/">Dan Mall</a> had said about creating element collages: &#8220;I start by putting elements on the page for which I have an idea in my mind for&#8221;. Having an idea for the display of comments, and with a little alcoholic lubrication, I took to <a href="http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/">Sketch</a> and started there.</p>
                
                <p>Diamonds quickly became a unifying motif throughout this exploratory stage. Not only did this shape produce interesting crops and create a visual tension on the page, it also hinted at the season without going to the lengths of adding stars or Christmas trees.</p>

                </figure>
                
                <p>For the typography, I settled on a pairing of <a href="http://www.latofonts.com/lato-free-fonts/">Lato</a> and <a href="http://ebensorkin.wordpress.com/">Merriweather</a>. For similar reasons discussed in <a href="http://paulrobertlloyd.com/2013/05/web_typography/">an earlier post</a>, I opted to use freely available fonts, with budget and ease of implementation at the forefront of my mind. This choice helped me typeset articles to a reasonable standard, yet using typefaces from different designers and with different metrics meant I was unable to mix them together inline. I looked at pairing Merriweather with its sans serif counterpart, yet its tracking was too loose for body copy.</p>

                        <p>Awkward.</p>

                <p>All the while, <a href="http://jessicahische.is/talkingtype">Jessica Hische&#8217;s advice</a> was in the back of my mind: could I have found a better pairing with more time? If confirmation were needed, nearing completion of the design I discovered that Lato is Polish for Summer! Hopefully this is something we can revisit next year.</p>

                <h2>Moving to code</h2>
                
                <p>By the time dConstruct arrived in September, I had enough elements to present an initial direction to Drew and the rest of the <em>24 ways</em> team. They loved what they saw, but frustratingly, I couldn&#8217;t progress beyond this stage. I had a clear idea for index pages (inspired in part by the design of the <a href="http://nytimes.com/skimmer">New York Times skimmer</a>), yet few ideas for how this might translate to other pages.</p>
                
                <p>With the deadline fast approaching, I abandoned Sketch and headed for the browser. Having already marked up the site (using <a href="http://github.com/paulrobertlloyd/barebones/">Barebones</a> to provide generic styling) I introduced elements of the new design and observed how it cascaded down and throughout pages. Soon enough, the design was informing the markup, which in turn was informing the design. A visual language was developing in front of me.</p>

                <h2>Content first, navigation last</h2>
                
                <p>While innovative and strongly conceptual, the previous design dominated the content. This was something I wanted to avoid; nothing should get in the way of being able to comfortably read an article. Setting aside traditional notions of layout, I explored different ways to navigate, inspired in part by mobile and tablet applications.</p>
                
                <p>As the boundary between desktop and mobile continues to blur, I felt encouraged to keep the main navigation recessed regardless of device. Beyond an article, users may want to discover related content, or catch up with other articles from a particular season: onward links that could be easily linked to from within the page. This suggested a navigation menu that needn&#8217;t be persistent; just because you have space to display navigation, doesn&#8217;t mean that you should.</p>
                
                <p>Without user testing, this is all conjecture of course. I&#8217;d be interested in hearing how readers have found navigating the site.</p>
                
                <p>Even so, the design of the navigation changed quite a bit during the build process. By prototyping early on, I was able to test the ergonomics across different devices; the persistent right-hand position of the menu icon is one decision that resulted from such testing.</p>
                
                <h2>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want doors!&#8221;</h2>
                
                <p>That&#8217;s what Drew said when we first talked about the redesign. He was fairly clear about this, but I was certain there should be an element of hiding and reveal.</p>
                
                <p>Earlier this year <a href="http://benjystanton.co.uk/">Benjy Stanton</a> gave a talk at Port80 about <a href="http://slideshare.net/benjystanton/crafting-animation-on-the-web">animation on the web</a>. He pointed out that although we have the tools (or at least the technology) to achieve richer animation, it&#8217;s often neglected. Beyond transitioning between menu states, a small flap in the corner of each article summary that pealed open to reveal the author might add this extra layer of engagement.</p>
                
                <figure>
                    <img src="/_assets/2013/12/24_ways_animation_keyframes.png" alt=""/>

                    </figcaption>
                </figure>
                
                <p>Running short on time, I asked my friend (and <a href="http://joshemerson.co.uk/blog/using-svg-graphics-today"><abbr title="Scalable Vector Graphics">SVG</abbr> guru</a>) Josh Emerson for help. I imagined the resulting animation would use <abbr>SVG</abbr>, but it turns out there were significant issues with such an approach. Instead, Josh recommended I use <abbr>CSS</abbr> keyframe animations and background positioning with just a touch of JavaScript. Genius!</p>
                
                <p>Since the site launched, I&#8217;ve continued to tweak transitions and their values. This has been a frustrating exercise, sometimes having to forgo smoother transitions in order to avoid bizarre rendering bugs.</p>
                
                <h2>The pragmatist awoken</h2>
                
                <p>As much as I wanted to create an opinionated design, I also wanted to make a statement about progressive enhancement.</p>
                
                <p>While many subscribe to the notion that websites don&#8217;t need to look the same in every browser, they still include many lines of prefixed <abbr>CSS</abbr>, determined to make sure that any browser that can render a feature &#8211; regardless of the code required &#8211; does so.</p>
                
                <p>I wanted to implement the design in such a way that if a browser didn&#8217;t support a certain feature unprefixed &#8211; gradients, transitions, translations etc. &#8211; then a fallback would be seen instead. Users of the latest version of Firefox might see animated flaps yet not diamond shaped avatars, WebKit users the opposite.</p>
                
                <p>This thinking was found wanting. I had already built much of the site using a customised version of <a href="http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/">normalise.css</a> (which addresses browser inconsistencies using prefixed properties) and besides, those diamond avatars, while an enhancement, were integral to the design.</p>
                
                <p>Pragmatism got the better of me, as it should. After all, what is front-end development if not a dance on the line strung between idealism and pragmatism?</p>
                
                <h2>Modularity</h2>
                
                <p>I was keen to introduce more modularity into my code, do more with a <abbr>CSS</abbr> preprocessor, use a <abbr title="Block, Element, Modifier">BEM</abbr>-like approach for markup patterns and not require jQuery for any JavaScript functions. This last one got the better of me &#8211; at least in the short term &#8211; although <a href="http://zeptojs.com">Zepto</a> did help me keep page weight down.</p>
                
                <p>Although I didn&#8217;t employ strict adherence to the <abbr><a href="http://bem.info/">BEM</a></abbr> methodology, I found the underlying concept incredibly useful in helping me name patterns.</p>

                <p>As <em>24 ways</em> is entirely content-based, <abbr>HTML5</abbr>&#8217;s semantic elements were used extensively, all while making sure they generated a sensible document outline (something that&#8217;s often forgotten). Class names took inspiration from these elements, as terms like <code>article</code>, <code>summary</code>, <code>header</code>, <code>footer</code> and <code>main</code> mapped closely to the smaller patterns required.</p>
                
                <p>Taking inspiration from <abbr>BEM</abbr>, I used single word root classes, suffixed with a modifier if required. Child elements would use this root class, followed by an underscore and a description of that element. A additional layer of semantics was provided using <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/microformats-2/">Microformats 2</a> class names, although these were not referenced in the CSS.</p>
                
                <p><em>Sidenote: If you&#8217;re unconvinced about the need for methodologies like <abbr>BEM</abbr>, I&#8217;d encourage you to read <a href="http://nicolasgallagher.com/about-html-semantics-front-end-architecture/">Nicholas Gallagher&#8217;s thought provoking article</a> on semantics and front-end architecture.</em></p>

                <h2>Designing in the dark</h2>
                
                <p>It has been three weeks since the redesign was unveiled, and thankfully to a largely positive audience. It&#8217;s funny to think that just a week beforehand some of the design&#8217;s signature features still hadn&#8217;t been conceived. I really took it to the line! </p>
                
                <p>Indeed, if providing a critique, it&#8217;s important to recognise the constraints under which it was delivered. Working evenings and weekends meant I had little time to noodle on any particular design direction. Having left Clearleft and started working in London meant I no longer had easy access to a device lab. Waiting for my phone line to be installed meant I was unable to download and install the virtual machines needed for cross browser testing.</p>
                
                <p>Developing a responsive website without these resources can be a risky proposition, and what I&#8217;ve developed is largely a best guess. Once I have these tools in hand, I will likely revisit many of my design decisions.</p>
                
                <h2>What next?</h2>
                
                <p>Sadly, aspects of the design discussed earlier in the process were never addressed. For example, there was a desire to look at ways of surfacing archived content on the homepage between seasons, yet this was lost in the rush to get the site launched in time. Images &#8211; both in terms of art direction and their delivery in a responsive context &#8211; clearly need more thought.</p>
                
                <p>However, I&#8217;m a big believer in iteration, and not treating a website as ever being finished. I hope what&#8217;s been released this year can act as a foundation, and that the design will evolve in the years to come.</p>
