Alex Payne on Bitcoin: 

> Most charitably, Bitcoin is regarded as a flawed but nonetheless worthwhile experiment, one that has unfortunately attracted outsized attention and investment before correcting any number of [glaring security issues][1].
  
> To those less kind, Bitcoin has become synonymous with everything wrong with Silicon Valley: a marriage of dubious technology and [questionable][2] [economics][3] wrapped up in a crypto-libertarian political agenda that smacks of nerds-do-it-better paternalism.

Such criticism--that of the selfish logic behind the libertarian ideology prevalent in the Valley--will only grow louder in the coming year. Time to disrupt the disrupters, I say.
