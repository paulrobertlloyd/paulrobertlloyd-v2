        <div role="main" class="entry" id="page-270">
            
            <div class="prose">
                <p>Last week I attended <a href="http://2013.newadventuresconf.com">New Adventures</a> in Nottingham. This year&#8217;s line-up featured a fertile mix of practical advice (Jon Tan), thoughtful reflection (Stephanie Troeth), live coding (Seb Lee-Delisle) and characterful inspiration (Wayne Hemingway), with a few sweary truisms thrown in for good measure.</p>
                
                <p>In addition to the main track, conference sponsors <a href="http://www.ubelly.com">Ubelly</a> hosted <a href="http://www.ubelly.com/the-soapbox">The Soapbox</a>, a series of five 10-minute talks held during the lunch break. A well attended session, this proved a great opportunity for new (and not so new) speakers to take to the smallest stage in the venue &#8211; an <em>actual</em> soapbox &#8211; to present an idea or explain a topic concisely. It was a lot of fun.</p>
                
                <p><img src="/_assets/2013/01/ubelly.png" alt="Ubelly logo" class="right"/>Yet, beyond all the good stuff Ubelly is doing, I find the underlying proposition a little strange. Pitched as &#8216;the unofficial official Microsoft blog for developers who love the web&#8217;, I sense a degree of embarrassment in being a Microsoft programme. When many developers consider their relationship with Internet Explorer to be painful and enduring, perhaps that&#8217;s not surprising.</p>
                
                <p>Having once dominated the market, the corporation is now playing catch up. Ubelly is tasked with not only re-engaging the web community, but also encouraging developers to build software for Microsoft&#8217;s new &#8211; and often innovative &#8211; platforms. This can lead to odd scenarios, like that at the Soapbox event, where presenters had to use Powerpoint and Windows 8; cue apologies for fonts looking wrong and misplaced.</p>
                
                <p>Of course, when discussing platform evangelism, it&#8217;s important to remember that any outreach is preferable to the oath of silence Apple&#8217;s engineers have signed.</p>
                
                <h2>The Critters</h2>
                
                <p>My broader point is, I think, that Ubelly have their heart in the right place, but sometimes the tone feels a little bit off. One example of this is the Critters, their annual awards ceremony for which <a href="http://ubelly.com/thecritters/">nominations are now open</a>.</p>
                
                <p>I&#8217;m not a great fan of award ceremonies, but they do have their place. This is especially true when used to highlight new talent and honour those deserving of recognition.</p>
                
                <p>However, the nomination criteria for this year&#8217;s Critters is unclear, with the entry form consisting simply of a textfield below each category. Some awards are self-evident, but a few need further explanation (e.g. &#8216;Win of the Year&#8217; and &#8216;Voice of the Year&#8217;). One award should probably be removed altogether: &#8216;Web Personality of the Year&#8217;.</p>
                
                <p>What does that mean? Should YouTube celebrities like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/officialpsy">Psy</a> be nominated, or is it limited to those within our industry? I can think of many &#8216;personalities&#8217;, but not all have contributed positively. What values should nominees be judged against?</p>
                
                <p>I don&#8217;t subscribe to the notion of &#8216;web celebrity&#8217;, yet it becomes harder to dismiss such a meme when awards like this are handed out. Rather than highlight new talent, they appear to reinforce the status quo instead.</p>


                <p>If recipients of this award are those deserving of recognition &#8211; either for the quality of their work or taking it upon themselves to push the industry and the web forward &#8211; then surely it is better to state that. I imagine &#8216;Outstanding Contribution&#8217; would be a much more appealing honour for the winner than that of &#8216;Web Personality&#8217;.</p>
                
                <p>I suspect the title is influenced by the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/sports-personality/">BBC Sports Personality of the Year</a> award. Yet, sport is often marketed as entertainment, and the context around a particular industry matters when picking names for such things. Many web designers and developers are entertaining, but I wouldn&#8217;t want to see them on my television!</p>
                
                <h2>Fixing with Clarity</h2>
                
                <p>Previous editions of the <a href="http://www.netmagazine.com">.net Magazine</a> Awards had a similar category also. Thankfully they soon dropped it, and this year their awards seek to highlight new talent, projects and technical innovation.</p>
                
                <p>Notably, and unlike the nomination form for the Critters, <a href="http://netmagazine.com/netawards13">the criteria for each category is clearly stated</a>. They also include a few quotes from last year&#8217;s winners, such as this from Janna Hagan:</p>
                
                <blockquote>
                  <p>Winning the first .net Young Designer of the Year award was an absolute honour. Being recognised by such a large magazine within the design industry and some industry experts was a wonderful way for me to validate my skills and hard work. </p>
                </blockquote>
                
                <p>Clearly stating nomination criteria and choosing better award titles may seem like minor issues, but I believe the language around such events can influence the broader discourse. This has suffered in recent years thanks to 140-character sniping and <a href="http://christianheilmann.com/2013/01/27/drive-by-criticism-must-die/">drive-by criticism</a>.</p>
                
                <p>When awards are given out, they should encourage everyone to be finer practitioners, not louder personalities. Instead of putting people &#8211; however deserving &#8211; on pedestals out of reach of new talent, when done right, they can promote inclusivity and celebrate our collective achievement.</p>
                
                <p>Ubelly are fostering a young community, <a href="http://ubelly.com/nubelly">supporting new writers</a> and sponsoring events. I&#8217;m not sure their awards, in their current state, live up to the same standard.</p>
