> The trend away from skeuomorphic special effects in <abbr title="user interface">UI</abbr> design is the beginning of the retina-resolution design era. Our designs no longer need to accommodate for crude pixels. Glossy/glassy surfaces, heavy-handed transparency, glaring drop shadows, [embossed text][1], textured material surfaces--these hallmarks of modern <abbr>UI</abbr> graphic design style are (almost) never used in good print graphic design. They're unnecessary in print, and, the higher the quality of the output and more heavy-handed the effect, the sillier such techniques look.

John's article forms part of a larger discussion about the possible emergence of a truer digital aesthetic. [Flat interfaces][2], such as those seen in Microsoft's Metro <abbr>UI</abbr> and the BBC's <abbr title="Global Visual Language">GEL</abbr> project are certainly fashionable, and thankfully, to my taste. Simpler interfaces are particularly suited to the web; high-fidelity interfaces can require a large number of image assets or many lines of <abbr>CSS</abbr>, reducing overall performance. 

I'm not sure this trend has much to do with HiDPI displays though. I suspect, like most design movements, it's just a reaction to what proceeded it. Skeuomorphism is to [Art Nouveau][3] what flat design is to [minimalism][4]. What goes around, comes around.

Be sure to read [Max Rudberg's counter argument][5], too.
