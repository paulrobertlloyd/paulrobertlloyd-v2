Matthew Butterick's scrutiny of Medium reveals it to be "a form of human fracking":

> In ["Death to Typewriters,"][1] Medium insists that the typewriter is its "sworn enemy." In certain typographic details, maybe so. But as a device that imposes homogeneous design, Medium still has a lot in common with the typewriter.
>
> In fact, its ethics are actually _worse_ than the traditional typewriter. Why? Because Medium's homogeneous design has nothing to do with limitations of the underlying technology (in this case, the web)... it's a deliberate choice that lets Medium extract value from the talent and labor of others.

Convenience always has a cost.
