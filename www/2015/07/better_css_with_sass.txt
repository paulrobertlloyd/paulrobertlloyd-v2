For those looking for a quick and succinct introduction to Sass, the popular CSS pre-processor, my friend [Cole Henley][1] has written a pocket guide:

> Sass is a tool that takes a lot of the legwork out of writing good CSS. This pocket guide will provide an overview of how Sass can dramatically improve your workflow and make your CSS more flexible, robust and reusable.

This guide only takes 30 to 45 minutes to read, but on turning the last page you'll be up to speed on all the features of Sass, know why you may want to use them and be thinking about building upon these features to take your Sass usage to the next level -- careful now! The book is [available now from Five Simple Steps][2] for just Â£3.
