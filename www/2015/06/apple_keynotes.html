                <p><a href="https://twitter.com/paulrobertlloyd/status/607965028705267713">I tuned in for a few seconds, but had to turn it off</a>. That&#8217;s not enough time to make a reasoned judgement about the content of <a href="http://www.apple.com/live/2015-june-event/">Apple&#8217;s latest keynote</a> of course, but I just couldn&#8217;t continue watching.</p>
                
                <p>This wasn&#8217;t always the case as Apple keynotes were once something I relished.</p>
                
                <p>I distinctly remember one event that took place in 2005. I&#8217;m not sure why this particular keynote sticks in the memory (I think the main announcement was the inclusion of television episodes on iTunes). I suspect having recently upgraded to broadband, this was the first for which I could stream the video. But that evening, like many before it, was entirely consumed by a few announcements made in California.</p>
                
                <p>Today I find myself not only uninterested in Apple&#8217;s keynotes, but actually at a point where I can&#8217;t even watch them in the background. They have always been over-the-top in terms of presentation, with adjectives like &#8220;amazing&#8221;, &#8220;incredible&#8221;, &#8220;magical&#8221;, &#8220;gorgeous&#8221; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nx7v815bYUw">flowing like water</a>. But now they feel different, and I&#8217;m not sure why.</p>
                
                <p>Perhaps it&#8217;s my familiarity with the formula. A video featuring the opening of a new Apple Store with all the irritating whooping and hollering that must accompany it. A series of bar charts showing incredible product adoption. A few choice quotes from favoured journalists. Another video, maybe Jony Ive talking at great lengths about the redesign of an internal fan. Next up it&#8217;s Craig Federighi building his part, one dad joke at a time. Then one more thing (maybe). Finally, finish with a brief comment from Tim Cook about how &#8220;only Apple can do this&#8221; before concluding with Coldplay performing a few tracks from their latest album.</p>
                
                <p>Perhaps it&#8217;s because their products are no longer objects I desire, instead they have become simply tools I use to get my job done. Tools which everyone around me use as well; glowing Apples as far as the eye can see.</p>
                
                <p>Or perhaps  &#8211;  and this might be the most likely reason  &#8211;  participating in a marketing exercise carried out by the world&#8217;s most profitable corporation isn&#8217;t the same as following a plucky little computer company with less than 5% market share. Apple do many good things, and Tim Cook seems to possess a strong moral compass, but that hasn&#8217;t directed him towards fixing the company&#8217;s tax avoidance strategies. If he made Apple a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benefit_corporation">B-Corp</a>, I might believe more of the rhetoric.</p>
                
                <p>Apple are just another technology company, trying to sell me stuff I don&#8217;t want (and only sometimes need). And I no longer see the fun in that.</p>
