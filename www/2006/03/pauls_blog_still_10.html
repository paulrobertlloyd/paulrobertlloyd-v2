            <div class="prose">
                <p>I have a feeling &#8216;lloydyweb.org&#8217; may not make the flight back home.</p>
                
                <h2>The Name</h2>
                
                <p>What started out as a rush choice for a domain name seven years ago has since grown into an online pseudonym of sorts, and is today attached to many online accounts and even as part of my Yahoo <abbr title="Instant Messaging">IM</abbr> handle. Given it was my domain name it seemed the obvious choice when signing up for such services, but I can&#8217;t help but feel like I&#8217;ve grown out of it.</p>
                
                <p>If I was an earlier adaptor (both to these websites and obtaining a personal domain name) I could have chosen &#8216;paullloyd&#8217;, but I&#8217;m not a great fan of my real name either! In fact, I&#8217;m not keen on FourTwo (the name for which I christened my freelance business), so perhaps this is a medical condition? Maybe, I&#8217;m just bad at picking names.</p>
                
                <p>I would have chosen to represent myself with a symbol but not only did (the artist formal known as) Prince get there first, but I would have been limited to the &#8216;_&#8217; and &#8216;-&#8217; characters&#8230;</p>
                
                <p>Then there&#8217;s the .org. Whilst I may be international and to some extent organised, I&#8217;m certainly not an international organisation! Who knows what went through my mind as I picked that one!</p>
                
                <p>I&#8217;m currently in two minds as to what to do. As a precursor, I have registered lloydyweb.com (and .co.uk) as well as paulrobertlloyd.com (and .co.uk), but I can see me being stuck with LloydyWeb for many years to come. Unless anyone else has any suggestions?</p>
                
                <h2>My Writing Style</h2>
                
                <p>My blog started out back in the day as not a blog at all, but manually updated <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> &#8216;news updates&#8217; (old school!). As this slowly transformed into a blog, it remained pretty much (<a href="http://www.roobottom.com/2006/02/28/procrastination/">as Jon would put it</a>) &#8220;Today I went to the loo three times, and had corned beef hash for my tea&#8221;. I soon grew tired of such posts and in the last year I have made real efforts to try and post entries that have some sort of thought behind them (even if not a point).</p>
                
                <p>One of my biggest goals of keeping a blog was, and still is, to improve my written communication skills. This is one area I feel Jon excels in especially, and I&#8217;m not ashamed to let everyone know how insanely jealous of him I am for that.  I just hope my own style can improve with age too.</p>
                
                <p>I&#8217;m also a little concerned that my best search referrals come from being the top result in mis-spelt searches. Was a whole four years of primary education wasted?</p>
                
                <h2>Archives</h2>
                
                <p>At the moment I&#8217;m tempted to delete all posts written before a certain date (and I have in fact been slowly pruning the really embarrassing stuff as I&#8217;ve been going forward), but is that the right thing to do? As a representation of yourself online, should previous posts be kept as a lasting record, or if you no longer feel that these represent who you are today, should they be removed? It could be argued both ways, but I have a feeling the archives may be getting shorter quite soon.</p>
                
                <h2>Design</h2>
                
                <p>Okay, what with <a href="http://veerle.duoh.com/index.php/blog/comments/veerles_blog_now_20/">Veerle&#8217;s recent redesign</a> (and <a href="http://veerle.duoh.com/index.php/blog/comments/veerles_blog_now_20/">perhaps another high profile one on the way soon</a> too), it&#8217;s hard as a designer not to feel disheartened with ones own work. Aside from the fact the black is the new black and two column layouts are sooo 2003, I genuinely feel it&#8217;s time for a refresh. Which brings me on to&#8230;</p>
                
                <h2>Technology</h2>
                
                <p>Since this version of the site went live almost two years ago, &#8216;web 2.0&#8217; (for want of not having to use that buzzword) has taken off. A big part of this web renaissance, is the easy interchange and sharing of data and content. Here are just some of this new 2.0 goodness that I want to inject into this site:</p>
                
                <h3>Photos</h3>
                
                <p>I have made the decision (or the decision has been made for me) &#8211; I will be incorporating <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/paulrobertlloyd/">my flickr account</a> into the next design. Not only is this because I&#8217;m now totally addicted, but mainly due to the number of ways I can get my photos on to the site, quickly. This is especially important when travelling as much as I am currently.</p>
                
                <h3>Blog Posts</h3>
                
                <p>My most recent stuff is nowhere to be seen on <a href="http://www.technorati.com/search/lloydyweb.org">Technorati</a> or <a href="http://blogsearch.google.com/blogsearch?as_q=&amp;num=10&amp;hl=en&amp;c2coff=1&amp;btnG=Search+Blogs&amp;as_epq=&amp;as_oq=&amp;as_eq=&amp;bl_pt=&amp;bl_bt=&amp;bl_url=lloydyweb.org&amp;bl_auth=&amp;as_drrb=q&amp;as_qdr=&amp;as_mind=4&amp;as_minm=3&amp;as_miny=2005&amp;as_maxd=4&amp;as_maxm=3&amp;as_maxy=2006&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off">Google&#8217;s Blog Search</a>. I might as well not exist as a blog with out being more accessible to those two great tools. I&#8217;m looking at improving the categories, and adding Technorati tags to all my posts.</p>
                
                <h3>Bookmarks</h3>
                
                <p>Another service I&#8217;ve become addicted to within the last 6 months is <a href="http://del.icio.us/paulrobertlloyd/">del.icio.us</a>. Purely in terms of the way my bookmarks are currently being presented, it doesn&#8217;t do their frequency or quantity justice.</p>
                
                <p>There are lots of other great <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr>s and tools I would like to incorporate too (last.fm, LinkedIn, MicroFormats, Skype/<abbr>IM</abbr> status), but those listed above are definite areas that I want to focus on.</p>
                
                <p>I guess as a way of representing who I am online, this site hasn&#8217;t done a bad job. I have it to thank for both my current achievements, and as can be seen above, my future growth as a web developer. It&#8217;s just a shame I might not find the time to make the changes I feel I need to make, for quite a while yet.</p>
