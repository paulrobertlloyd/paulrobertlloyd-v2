Further to my post earlier this month about a possible name change for this site in its upcoming redesign, it soon became obvious through the comments and talking to friends that there is quite a bit of affection for the name 'LloydyWeb'. With that in mind, yesterday I changed over to my new and improved domain: lloydyweb.com.

Does this mean the LloydyWeb, a 'not-for-profit international organisation' is now turning itself over to the world of commerce, commercialism and mass-consumerisation? Oh those heady days when top level domains actually meant something, how we laugh!

In short, update your bookmarks, update your links to my site (my Technorati profile is a tad sadder looking now), and Gogglebot--come get me girl!
