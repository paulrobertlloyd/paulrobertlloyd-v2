I have a feeling 'lloydyweb.org' may not make the flight back home.

## The Name

What started out as a rush choice for a domain name seven years ago has since grown into an online pseudonym of sorts, and is today attached to many online accounts and even as part of my Yahoo <abbr title="Instant Messaging">IM</abbr> handle. Given it was my domain name it seemed the obvious choice when signing up for such services, but I can't help but feel like I've grown out of it.

If I was an earlier adaptor (both to these websites and obtaining a personal domain name) I could have chosen 'paullloyd', but I'm not a great fan of my real name either! In fact, I'm not keen on FourTwo (the name for which I christened my freelance business), so perhaps this is a medical condition? Maybe, I'm just bad at picking names.

I would have chosen to represent myself with a symbol but not only did (the artist formal known as) Prince get there first, but I would have been limited to the '_' and '-' characters...

Then there's the .org. Whilst I may be international and to some extent organised, I'm certainly not an international organisation! Who knows what went through my mind as I picked that one!

I'm currently in two minds as to what to do. As a precursor, I have registered lloydyweb.com (and .co.uk) as well as paulrobertlloyd.com (and .co.uk), but I can see me being stuck with LloydyWeb for many years to come. Unless anyone else has any suggestions?

## My Writing Style 

My blog started out back in the day as not a blog at all, but manually updated <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> 'news updates' (old school!). As this slowly transformed into a blog, it remained pretty much ([as Jon would put it][1]) "Today I went to the loo three times, and had corned beef hash for my tea". I soon grew tired of such posts and in the last year I have made real efforts to try and post entries that have some sort of thought behind them (even if not a point).

One of my biggest goals of keeping a blog was, and still is, to improve my written communication skills. This is one area I feel Jon excels in especially, and I'm not ashamed to let everyone know how insanely jealous of him I am for that.  I just hope my own style can improve with age too.

I'm also a little concerned that my best search referrals come from being the top result in mis-spelt searches. Was a whole four years of primary education wasted?

## Archives

At the moment I'm tempted to delete all posts written before a certain date (and I have in fact been slowly pruning the really embarrassing stuff as I've been going forward), but is that the right thing to do? As a representation of yourself online, should previous posts be kept as a lasting record, or if you no longer feel that these represent who you are today, should they be removed? It could be argued both ways, but I have a feeling the archives may be getting shorter quite soon.

## Design

Okay, what with [Veerle's recent redesign][2] (and [perhaps another high profile one on the way soon][2] too), it's hard as a designer not to feel disheartened with ones own work. Aside from the fact the black is the new black and two column layouts are sooo 2003, I genuinely feel it's time for a refresh. Which brings me on to...

## Technology

Since this version of the site went live almost two years ago, 'web 2.0' (for want of not having to use that buzzword) has taken off. A big part of this web renaissance, is the easy interchange and sharing of data and content. Here are just some of this new 2.0 goodness that I want to inject into this site:

### Photos

I have made the decision (or the decision has been made for me)--I will be incorporating [my flickr account][4] into the next design. Not only is this because I'm now totally addicted, but mainly due to the number of ways I can get my photos on to the site, quickly. This is especially important when travelling as much as I am currently.

### Blog Posts

My most recent stuff is nowhere to be seen on [Technorati][5] or [Google's Blog Search][6]. I might as well not exist as a blog with out being more accessible to those two great tools. I'm looking at improving the categories, and adding Technorati tags to all my posts.

### Bookmarks

Another service I've become addicted to within the last 6 months is [del.icio.us][7]. Purely in terms of the way my bookmarks are currently being presented, it doesn't do their frequency or quantity justice.

There are lots of other great <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr>s and tools I would like to incorporate too (last.fm, LinkedIn, MicroFormats, Skype/<abbr>IM</abbr> status), but those listed above are definite areas that I want to focus on.

I guess as a way of representing who I am online, this site hasn't done a bad job. I have it to thank for both my current achievements, and as can be seen above, my future growth as a web developer. It's just a shame I might not find the time to make the changes I feel I need to make, for quite a while yet.
