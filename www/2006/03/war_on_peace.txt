Only at an anti Iraq war demo in Palo Alto could a fight break out. The dialogue between a demonstrator, and a couple of bystanders went something like this:

**Demonstrator:** Thanks for your support sir! All the best to you and your children!

**Bystander:** I don't have any children...

**Demonstrator (walking away):** Son of a bitch!

**Second Bystander:** Hey, watch your language!

**Demonstrator (aggressive):** What did you say?

**Second Bystander:** There was no call for that...

...and before the fight could begin the police stepped in! And you wonder why America has trouble 'liberating' Iraq...
