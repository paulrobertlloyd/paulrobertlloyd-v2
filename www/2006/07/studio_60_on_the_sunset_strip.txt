Dubbed by many as the West Wing meets Hollywood, <cite>Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip</cite> stars many of my favourite actors from that show including [Bradley Whitford][1] (who played Josh Lyman), [Matthew Perry][2] (Joe Quincy), [Timothy Busfield][3] (Danny Concannon) and surely it's a matter of time before [Joshua Malina][4] appears on the new show too (having appeared in every Aaron Sorkin project to date). It also stars [Nate Corddry][5], who will be familiar to [Daily Show][6] viewers.

I'm really looking forward to this one, and should hopefully fill the gap left by the axed West Wing. <cite>Studio 60</cite> airs 'in the fall' in the States on <abbr title="National Broadcasting Company">NBC</abbr>, but I would imagine it would arrive in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> the beginning of next year, and no doubt on Channel 4.
