Organised by [Trevor Morris][1] and presented by the [Multipack][2], next month (August 27th) sees the first annual Geek in the Park:

  > Geek in the Park is a day-long get together, picnic, and discussion for anyone to do with the Internet (developers, designers, programmers... whatever!). This is a very informal affair so family and friends are very much welcome to attend too.

The big day is taking place in Royal Leamington Spa, Warwickshire. Split in to two main events, [Geek in the Park][3] starts with The Picnic during the day, followed by The Discussion in the evening. The event starts on Sunday at noon and everything should wrap up by around 11pm.

The Discussion will focus around [Patrick H. Lauke][4] and [Bruce Lawson][5] who will both be discussing <cite>Where the rubber meets the road: Web Accessibility and Pragmatism</cite>.

Needless to say I'll be there, soaking up the sun during the day (fingers crossed) and getting my geek on in the evening--and hopefully winning a Friends of Ed book or two!
