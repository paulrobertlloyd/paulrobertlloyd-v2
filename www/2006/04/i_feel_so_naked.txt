For today only, I'm letting you see under my <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> clothes and peak at my muscular (semantic) physique. I'm a bit late to the party on this one, but I thought I'd give [<abbr>CSS</abbr> Naked Day][1] a go (a great little idea from [Dustin Diaz][2]).

Like the [Four Things][3] meme earlier this year, this event has spread like wildfire. Much as I enjoyed finding out more about those behind my favourite blogs, perhaps <abbr>CSS</abbr> Naked Day will prove to be just as positive, and further promote the benefits of clean, structured and semantic mark-up to the masses.
