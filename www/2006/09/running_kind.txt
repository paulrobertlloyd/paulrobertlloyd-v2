I won't be participating in this years Great North Run. However two friends of mine will be running for worthy charities in the coming weeks, so I would just like to add a few words of support, and even help them gain extra sponsorship in the process.

## Ed Lawrence

Formerly a victim of many office pranks (usually instigated by myself), Ed will be running the [Great North Run][1] on Sunday, October 1st, and is hoping to raise �500 for [Simone's Tribute Fund][2]. This is the same charity I ran for [earlier this year in Manchester][3], and raised �350 (again, a big thank-you to all those that supported me).

You can sponsor Ed online at: <http://www.justgiving.com/edlawrence>

## Mike Robertson

As October draws to a close, another friend of mine, whom I first met during my month in Australia a few years back, will be running the [Dublin Marathon][4] in aid of the homeless charity, [Crisis][5]. Having run only half-marathons myself, I have a lot of respect for a guy who can run 26 miles, before taking in a local museum or two.

You can sponsor Mike online too, at: <http://www.justgiving.com/mikerobertson>

Best of luck to both runners!
