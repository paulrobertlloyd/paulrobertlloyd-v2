                <p>Unsurprisingly, I feel compelled to write a review of this last year which I think I can say with some confidence has been very different from previous years. Having said that it seems like I&#8217;ve spent the last five or so months looking back. Some recent posts on this blog are ample proof of the sort of reflective mood I&#8217;ve been in lately.</p>
                
                <h2>Ning</h2>
                
                <p>A lot of this came as a result of my <del>new</del> job at Ning, Inc. and my (eventual) relocation to California. As the hours tick down to a new year, I finally feel like I&#8217;ve settled into my new surroundings, and I&#8217;m very much looking forward to the challenges that me and the company will face during the next 12 months. From my point of view, 2006 was very much a year in which Ning was still finding it&#8217;s way, and as such there were definitely a few dodgy moments along the way.</p>
                
                <p>Going into 2007, we have an (already) awesome product that we will be launching to the world around mid February, and I feel really positive about it. If it turns out to be a success (and I think it could be), who knows what the next year will hold for me and the team.</p>

                </ul>
                
                <h2>Travel</h2>
                
                <p>Whilst I spent half of this year in California, I also finally set foot on the European continent, spending a week in Italy alongside my friend Nancy and her sister.  Whilst I&#8217;m glad I visited the Italian capital and the Vatican, Florence was a particular highlight of this trip. Before the year was out I was also able to spend a few days in New York, a city I&#8217;ve always wanted to visit, and was suitably impressed.</p>
                
                <p>However, the most enjoyable trip of 2006 took place a little closer to home, with a weekend spent in Littlehampton alongside Jon, his girlfriend Katie, Nash, Ellen and a number of others.</p>

                </ul>
                
                <h2>Personal Growth</h2>
                
                <p>I&#8217;m tending to view 2006 as a bad year, which is bizarre as the facts speak otherwise. Yes, it was a year in which I got punched in the face, had my heart broken, faced constantly changing surroundings (having lived at four different addresses) alongside numerous other frustrations, but I guess this was to be expected as it was a year of tremendous personal change &#8211; and a change that needed to happen if I&#8217;m honest.</p>

                </ul>
                
                <h2>Looking Forward</h2>
                
                <p>As I draw a line under 2006, and enter this new year, I can do so with much to look forward to.  A weekend in Vegas in January, new product launches at Ning during February, a couple of weddings, as well as number of friends hopefully making the trip over to the States during the course of the year, means I&#8217;m really relishing the next twelve months.</p>
                
                <p>Happy New Year!</p>
