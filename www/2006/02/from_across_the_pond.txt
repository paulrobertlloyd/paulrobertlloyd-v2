I will no doubt update this list over the coming months, but here are some initial observations from my time spent in the states so far:

  * Everybody is incredibly friendly.
  * The ground floor is called the first floor. Whilst I can understand the reasoning, it has caused a little confusion at times.
  * Information on the back of pharmaceuticals has a standardised layout. What a good idea!
  * Talking about good ideas, the system of dividing a neighbourhood into blocks is just brilliant!
  * The trains run on time and to schedule, certainly from what small experience I've had so far.
  * In San Francisco, the in-store music gets turned up a notch whenever a George Michael song plays!

In terms of television:

  * Jimmy Carr is on the television here too. Is there no escaping the man?
  * So is Harry Enfield--all be it advertising cheeseburgers for Burger King. How the mighty fall.
  * They have the Antiques Road show here too, and in primetime!
  * Every poor celebrity reality television show you can think of that airs in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> has its respective version over here. The celebrities are just as Z-list as they are in the <abbr>UK</abbr>.
  * To be a female news anchor you need to sound like a man (or at least deepen your voice)
  * I no longer have any idea what's happening in the rest of the world. However I do have more than enough information about the weather and all criminal activity in the entire Bay Area.

Need I say more about how I have been spending my evenings so far...
