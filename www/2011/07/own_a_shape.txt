Clayton Miller:

  > Microsoft's Metro <abbr title="User Interface">UI</abbr> owns the square. Apple has a corner on the roundrect, from the Springboard launcher to the iPhone hardware itself. Nokia, despite its late entry with MeeGo's Harmattan <abbr>UI</abbr>, found the squircle unclaimed and ran with it beautifully. Palm has used the circle from the early days of PalmOS, and in WebOS, <abbr title="Hewlett-Packard">HP</abbr> continues the tradition with care (one might even note that both Palm and <abbr>HP</abbr> structure their wordmarks around the circle).

I have a nagging feeling this observation will become useful on future projects. (Via [John Gruber][1])
