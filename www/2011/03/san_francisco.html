            <div class="prose">
                <p>Following five days in Austin, I ventured on to San Francisco. A quick stop arranged primarily to catch up with friends, I made sure my stay would be long enough to see all the sights I neglected to visit whilst I was a resident.</p>

                    </figcaption>
                </figure>
                
                <p>On my first day in the city, I took advantage of my hosts proximity to the Marina district and visited Fisherman&#8217;s Wharf and the Sea Lions at Pier 39. I have no shame, I enjoyed being a tourist.</p>
                
                <p>After finding some lunch in the Ferry Building, I began my hunt for an Internet cafe. Not long ago I suspect this city had more of these per capita than any other, but it&#8217;s probably Wi-Fi hotspots that maintain this position now. Only once I had crossed the poverty line that is Fifth and Market was I able to find a friendly cafe with a suite of connected iMacs &#8211; and a proprietor all to happy to charge me 16 cents a minute for their use.</p>


                <p>The following day I visited <abbr title="San Francisco Museum of Modern Art">SFMoMA</abbr>, a modern art museum that is far more spacious than you&#8217;d suspect from the outside. I was struck by how consistent this building is styled; its strong linear patterned brickwork exterior imitated inside with rough and smooth marble walls and careful wood detailing.</p>
                
                <p>Before going on to visit the equally impressive City Hall, I enjoyed a discussion about the role of technology with <a href="http://tristanharris.com/">Tristan</a> in South Park, whilst sipping an Iced Latte &#8211; when in Rome do as the Romans do. That evening I shared a selection of scrumptious pizzas at Zero Zero with David and Athena whilst catching up on the latest gossip and industry insight.</p>

                </figure>
                
                <p>On Friday, I headed south to Palo Alto, where I wandered around the beautiful grounds of Stanford University &#8211; why I never did this whilst I lived so close I don&#8217;t know, as the free Marguerite shuttle made doing so all too easy. That evening I had dinner with Steve in a Redwood City pub that had a subtle British theme; the table service supplied a well prepared selection of dishes, including many inspired by traditional English faire, with the background music sourced from my side of the Atlantic.</p>
                
                <p>On Saturday, my final day in the city, I traversed the rain drenched streets to visit the de Young museum in Golden Gate Park. Given the down pour, this proved a popular destination with many of its exhibition rooms crowded, not helped by the accompanying and rather garish floral displays that reduced floor space even further. I found many of the artefacts of little interest, but encouraged by David I spent some time looking at their Papua New Guinea collection, which made the visit worth while.</p>
                
                <p>On both visiting the de Young and <abbr>SFMoMA</abbr>, I couldn&#8217;t shake the underlying feeling that these institutions exist to foster exclusivity rather than inclusivity; this may just have been my reaction on having to pay so much to enter. Here again, America presented itself as a reminder that life in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> could be far worse, and I left thankful that I can visit similar museums in the <abbr>UK</abbr> free of charge.</p>
                
                <p>It&#8217;s such comparisons that surely led to my leaving the country in 2008, yet other reasons seem all too ready to be questioned every time I return &#8211; either by me or by others. Perhaps rightly so.</p>
                
                <p>Indeed, when asked how it felt to &#8216;be back&#8217;, I was surprised by my immediate defiance: &#8216;I&#8217;m not back&#8217; I retorted, &#8216;I&#8217;m just visiting&#8217;. Even the slightest notion that this visit may become permanent, became strangely concerning to me.</p>
                
                <p>As I walked the streets of San Francisco, buoyed by their comfortable familiarity and unique soundtrack, I knew that this was still a city I could never call home.</p>
