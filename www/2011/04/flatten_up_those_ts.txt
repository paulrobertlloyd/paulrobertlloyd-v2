Invaluable advise from Twitter's Mark Otto:

  > If you're a graphic designer, work towards bringing whatever print experience you have to a small single page site. If you're an interaction designer, start checking out HTML and CSS, and then move on to some basic jQuery. By doing so, you become a much more versatile designer and contributor on any project.
