                <p>Hard to believe that it is May already; another year that&#8217;s flying by. Luckily it has been fairly fun packed so far, with much of this excitement thanks to the many web conferences I&#8217;ve been to this year. It kicked off with <a href="http://www.thedesignofunderstanding.com/">The Design of Understanding</a> and <a href="http://newadventuresconf.com/">New Adventures</a> in January, with <abbr title="South by Southwest">SXSW</abbr> following in March, and only last month I was attending <a href="http://2011.uxlondon.com/"><abbr>UX</abbr> London</a>. It hasn&#8217;t just been the big events either; tomorrow sees a mobile focused <a href="http://www.multipack.co.uk/presents/mobile-development/">Multipack Presents</a>, which due to its growing popularity has now relocated to a larger venue.</p>
                
                <p>I&#8217;ve also been trying my hand at speaking myself, largely around themes of <a href="/2010/12/styleguides_for_the_web/">style guides</a> and <a href="/2011/03/web_native/">web native design</a>. I deliberately started with small appearances in front of friends at Multipack events before speaking to less familiar faces at an <a href="http://www.apa.co.uk/news/digital-breakfast-web-design-trends-tues-08-march/"><abbr title="Association of Publishing Agencies">APA</abbr> Digital Breakfast</a> in March. Last month I spoke at <a href="http://oxford.geeknights.net/2011/apr-13th/">Oxford Geek Nights</a>, a fantastically popular event that meant presenting with a microphone for the first time &#8211; far harder than you would imagine. Once I got over my initial nerves and found my flow, I was enjoying myself so much that I honestly didn&#8217;t want to stop! For those curious how I did, there should be video of my talk online shortly.</p>
                
                <p>Still, I&#8217;m an attendee at heart, and if there is one thing that governs my choice of conference, it&#8217;s a single track. I too share <a href="http://adactio.com/journal/4557/">Jeremy&#8217;s frustration</a> with multiple track conferences, especially those that distinguish between design and development which I believe is a largely false division. There&#8217;s something about a single track conference that makes it feel more curated and focused, with everyone&#8217;s collective experience allowing for common themes and ideas to emerge.</p>


                <h2>Ampersand</h2>
                
                <p>With that in mind, and excusing the obvious bias, I&#8217;m massively looking forward to <a href="http://ampersandconf.com/">Ampersand</a>, Clearleft&#8217;s new conference tightly focused around web typography. This is a topic which, as <a href="http://clagnut.com/blog/2361/">Rich suggests</a>, many designers would benefit from having a deeper understanding:</p>
                
                <blockquote>
                  <p>There&#8217;s so many interwoven, and sometimes adversarial, disciplines involved that I felt that everyone&#8217;s tale needed to be told. I wanted to try and tell the whole story in one day, from experts and practitioners of the different disciplines. I felt that if I, as primarily a website designer, knew more about the type design decisions, the hinting process, the issues browser makers have, then I could become a better designer.</p>
                </blockquote>
                
                <p><img src="/_assets/2011/05/ampersand.png" alt="Ampersand logo" class="right"/>Obviously web typography is a topic close to Clearleft&#8217;s heart, especially given our day-to-day experience working on <a href="http://fontdeck.com/">Fontdeck</a> and helping foundries bring their fonts to the web. Yet as Rich explains, there is something for everyone designing on the web &#8211; <a href="http://www.informationarchitects.jp/en/the-web-is-all-about-typography-period/">the web is all about typography</a> after all. I think this event promises to be really special, even more so given the <a href="http://www.ligatureloopandstem.com/product/lesson-plan-second-flight/">giveaways</a>, Phil Baines type tour and <a href="http://blog.fontdeck.com/post/5336616916/">$20 worth of free webfonts</a> for each attendee.</p>
                
                <p>Perhaps more noteworthy however, is that this emerging industry has maintained the community feel of the web standards movement it was born out of; it&#8217;s fantastic to see both Typekit and MyFonts sponsoring the parties, with WebType and Hoefler &amp; Frere Jones around on the day too.</p>
                
                <p>There are still tickets available, so if you haven&#8217;t done so already, you&#8217;d better <a href="http://ampersandconf.eventbrite.com/">grab a ticket</a> soon. The conference takes place in the Brighton Dome Corn Exchange on the 17th June, and tickets cost just ï¿½125 (or just half price for students).</p>
                
                <h2>More to come</h2>
                
                <p>If this wasn&#8217;t enough, <a href="http://2011.geekinthepark.co.uk/">Geek in the Park</a> returns in August shortly before <a href="http://2011.dconstruct.org/">dConstruct</a> will attempt to improve on last years widely applauded edition. This year it will form part of the new <a href="http://brightondigitalfestival.co.uk/">Brighton Digital Festival</a>.</p>
                
                <p>The event I&#8217;m really looking forward to however is <a href="http://aneventapart.com/2011/dc/">An Event Apart DC</a> in October. I&#8217;ve experienced this conference series twice before and loved each and every minute; with Jeremy waxing lyrical about this year&#8217;s line up of speakers, I could no longer resist a third visit.</p>
                
                <p>Hopefully this east coast activity, and my brief return to San Francisco for <a href="http://twitter.com/dpc47">Dan</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/lizes">Lizes</a> wedding a week later, will give me enough time to traverse the continent by train again. I&#8217;ve been looking at travelling on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_(train)">Canadian</a>, departing from Toronto and stepping off the train four days later in Vancouver. That&#8217;s four whole days. On a train. I need to think this one through!</p>
                
                <p>So, there we have it. Lots to look forward to, and still much to plan, yet I suspect all too soon this will be yesterday&#8217;s news. Should you wish to follow which conferences I&#8217;m attending or speaking at, be sure to <a href="http://lanyrd.com/people/paulrobertlloyd/">visit my profile</a> on the increasingly amazing Lanyrd.</p>
