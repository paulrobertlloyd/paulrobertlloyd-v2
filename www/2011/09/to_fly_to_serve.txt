Whatever you may think of British Airways, it's hard not to be impressed by this latest campaign. Part of a brand repositioning exercise that sees [the return of the company's coat of arms][1], this advert meticulously recounts the history of <abbr title="British Airways">BA</abbr> through its planes, people, ancestor companies and branding. It also features a nostalgic nod to Concorde, which still looks like an aircraft of the future rather than one of the past.

In many ways, I'm reminded of [a similarly retro themed advert][2] that <abbr>BA</abbr>'s arch rival Virgin Atlantic produced to celebrate their 25th anniversary in 2009.
