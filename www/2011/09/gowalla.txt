Garrett Murray perfectly sums up my thoughts on the changes to Gowalla:

> This version steps away from the straight-forward check-in functionality and replaces it with a more social version called "stories" The basic idea is that you create a story at a location, tag your friends, upload photos and comment. I think this is a terrific idea, and I think it's something relatively unique in the check-in app space.

> But it's not what I want.

I'm willing to keep the app on my iPhone for a little while, if only in the hope that the new city guides will prove useful during my forthcoming trip to the <abbr title="United States">US</abbr> and Canada. Still, it's hard to see myself using this application much more than I used to, if at all.
