                <p>Banks aren&#8217;t the most likeable organisations, but I&#8217;m developing a soft spot for <a href="https://www.kiwibank.co.nz/">Kiwibank</a>, a New Zealand-based bank competing against larger Australian-based rivals. Their <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=UyaakUyciGg">latest advertising campaign</a> suggests they&#8217;re willing to stand up for something new &#8220;and even a bit crazy&#8221;, and in the world of banking, a responsive website is just that. With mobile traffic pushing past 10%, they asked <a href="http://www.springload.co.nz/">Springload</a> to help them become device agnostic.</p>
                
                <p>Bron Thomson, Springload&#8217;s founder and Managing Director told me how they created Kiwibank&#8217;s new responsive website.</p>
                
                <h3>Why did you take the responsive approach?</h3>
                
                <blockquote>
                  <p>Kiwibank has this fantastic ambition to be a digital leader among New Zealand companies &#8211; not just banks. There&#8217;s a roadmap of digital initiatives that are pretty revolutionary, and with mobile traffic pushing past 10% of Kiwibank&#8217;s total traffic (and set to overtake desktop traffic in the coming years), the decision was made to go device agnostic. The fixed-width desktop paradigm has run its useful course &#8211; last year, we noticed that 20 people tried to join Kiwibank from their Playstation 3. </p>
                </blockquote>
                
                <h3>Only the home page is responsive currently. What challenges did this create, and how are you managing users expectations during the transition?</h3>
                
                <blockquote>
                  <p>Working on a content-rich site of this scale is kind of like painting a boat &#8211; you&#8217;re never really finished. With that in mind, Kiwibank&#8217;s social media team have been really open with customers about the changes we&#8217;re making (and why). We started going responsive last year on some key inside pages &#8211; the <a href="https://www.kiwibank.co.nz/join/">Join</a> page, <a href="https://www.kiwibank.co.nz/personal-banking/home-loans/first-home-buyers/">First Home Buyers Guide</a>, and the <a href="https://www.kiwibank.co.nz/personal-banking/ways-to-bank/">Ways to Bank</a> section. </p>
                
                <p>In the past we&#8217;ve run beta versions of the Kiwibank homepage to showcase new ideas, however the latest refresh was deployed virtually overnight to co-incide with a new brand launch involving a dozen or so other agencies. </p>
                
                <p>There&#8217;s always an understandable reaction when you change one of New Zealand&#8217;s most loved brands, we&#8217;re listening to user feedback and continually working on making the experience better. Kiwibank&#8217;s challenger-brand ethos puts us in good stead to keep pushing the web experience further.</p>
                </blockquote>
                
                <h3>Is this the first responsive site Springload have worked on?</h3>
                
                <blockquote>
                  <p>We&#8217;ve tested a range of approaches over the last couple of years: Specific m-dot sites in jQuery mobile (<a href="http://festival.co.nz/">festival.co.nz</a>), PhoneGap wrapped web apps (the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/nz/app/kiwibank-mobile-banking/id504216653">Kiwibank mobile banking app</a> and some internal tools), and we&#8217;re delving into native iOS as well. These are all valid, but quickly get quite complex. You end up with two or three different sets of device-specific logic, which is a maintenance nightmare. We&#8217;re pretty convinced that a responsive approach gives the widest number of people a great web experience regardless of how they access it, and simplifies content management for the site owner.</p>
                
                <p>Another responsive project we&#8217;ve finished recently is <a href="http://klim.co.nz/">klim.co.nz</a> for type guru Kris Sowersby.</p>
                </blockquote>
                
                <h3>Was there anything you learnt whilst designing/building this site?</h3>
                
                <blockquote>
                  <p>Content is really, really important. We&#8217;ve banned Lorem Ipsum in the office, and we try not to have a typical client/agency relationship &#8211; the Kiwibank copywriting team come and work at Springload <abbr>HQ</abbr> a couple of days a week. They also enjoy our beer. </p>
                
                <p>We built a number of our own tools to make going responsive easier for ourselves, check out <a href="http://www.responsinator.com/">Responsinator</a>. We&#8217;ll be sharing some of the other tools and plugins on our <a href="http://www.springload.co.nz/love-the-web/">blog</a>, stay tuned to <a href="http://twitter.com/springloadnz">@springloadnz</a>.</p>
                
                <p>It&#8217;s worth noting that there are no real magic bullets. We use a combination of server-side device detection, media queries and <abbr>JS</abbr> capability detection to decide what gets rendered to the page. We try and avoid polyfilling (preferring progressive enhancement where possible) and we&#8217;re using <abbr>CSS</abbr> transitions rather than jQuery to handle animation. </p>
                </blockquote>
                
                <h3>How has the design process changed to encompass a responsive workflow?</h3>
                
                <blockquote>
                  <p>One of the key changes has been to start the whole team (designers, developers, front-end devs) on the project at once. Even before the designs were finished, we needed a slick front-end framework, and the back end guys had to wrestle the <abbr>IIS</abbr>/<abbr>ASP</abbr> classic server into submission too. Having the whole team locked-down on the project made the decision making process much snappier and enabled us to solve problems without calling too many meetings. </p>
                
                <p>Photoshop is getting opened a little less &#8211; we mock up key navigation assets and a refined visual of a desktop and mobile template. From there, we&#8217;re learning the most by getting into the browser, and refining specific elements as we go. </p>
                
                <p>We have to test more devices, more often. For instance, the stylesheet that&#8217;s rendering <abbr>3D</abbr>, hardware-accelerated transitions on an iPhone also has to fix the box model in IE7. We made the move to <abbr title="Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets">SaSS</abbr> to help our front-end developers organise some of this complexity, and it&#8217;s working a treat.</p>
