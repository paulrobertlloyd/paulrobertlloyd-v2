> We're building a real-time social service where users and developers come first, not advertisers.
  
> Our team has spent the last 9 years building social services, developer platforms, mobile applications and more.
  
> We believe that advertising-supported social services are so consistently and inextricably at odds with the interests of users and developers that something must be done.
  
> Help us create the service we all wish existed.

Putting my money where my mouth's been for the last few years, and backing this [audacious][1] project. I hope it succeeds.
