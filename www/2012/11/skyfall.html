                <p>Fifty years after the release of <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0055928/"><cite>Dr. No</cite></a>, James Bond returns in <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt1074638/"><cite>Skyfall</cite></a>, the twenty-third instalment of the longest continually-running film series in history.</p>
                
                <p>With so many films in the canon, it&#8217;s surprising that this is the first directed by an Oscar-winning director. Sam Mendes has assembled a cast most movie goers will recognise: Ralph Fiennes, Javier Bardem and Albert Finney play key characters in the movie.</p>
                
                <p>This is Daniel Craig&#8217;s third outing as James Bond, although the narrative arc breaks away from that followed in the previous two films. Judi Dench, another series regular, returns as M with a role more pivotal to the story. From the official synopsis:</p>
                
                <blockquote>
                  <p>Bond&#8217;s loyalty to M is tested as her past comes back to haunt her. As <abbr title="Military Intelligence, Section 6">MI6</abbr> comes under attack, 007 must track down and destroy the threat, no matter how personal the cost.</p>
                </blockquote>
                
                <p>That past appears in the form of Raoul Silva, a former <abbr>MI6</abbr> agent turned cyber terrorist gleefully portrayed by Javier Bardem. Silva, is   a character tainted with just the right amount of comic book devilishness, and his origin story produces a grizzly reveal mid-way through the film. This, alongside his distinctive looks and exuberant style, easily rank Silva as the best Bond villain in a generation.</p>
                
                <figure>
                    <img src="/_assets/2012/11/skyfall-silva.jpg" alt=""/>

                    </figcaption>
                </figure>
                
                <p>Equalling Bardem&#8217;s performance, Daniel Craig wrestles the crown of best Bond away from Sean Connery. Having grown more comfortable in the role, his pithy one-liners sit more naturally within the dialogue. All the classic Bond mannerisms and traits are there, although again he orders his favourite drink without saying the immortal &#8216;shaken, not stirred&#8217; line.</p>
                
                <p>Unlike previous films, much of the action remains in the <abbr>UK</abbr>. This lends a different feel to the movie, and re-establishes Bond as someone who exists within the bounds of reality, far removed from the overly fictions elements that plagued previous movies.</p>
                
                <p>While a treat for domestic audiences to see Bond running around the streets of London, the scenes set in more exotic locations &#8211; a bike chase across the rooftops of Istanbul, a fist fight in neon-drenched Shanghai, drinks in a Macau casino &#8211; are a reminder that Bond works best when furthest away from his desk. The luscious colours found in Roger Deakins&#8217; stunning cinematography ensure these far-flung locations are visually arresting, contrasting with the more sombre palettes of Whitehall and the Scottish highlands.</p>

                        <p>The role of M, played by Judi Dench, is central to the story.</p>

                </figure>
                
                <p>There was product placement &#8211; something that has featured in Bond movies since the start &#8211; but thankfully this was achieved without any obvious &#8216;ca-ching&#8217; moments.</p>
                
                <p>That said, the real star of the movie is the iconic silver-birch Aston Martin DB5. Its appearance doesn&#8217;t so much give a subtle nod to the past, but knowingly transitions the story to another time, with features of the <cite>Goldfinger</cite> original used once more. Indeed, the camera is unable to turn itself away from the car&#8217;s sleek curves, and long lingering shots prevail from the moment it&#8217;s revealed to its eventual demise.</p>
                
                <hr />
                
                <p>The return of the classic Aston Martin is just one way in which the fifty year anniversary is celebrated, and at times this self-referential aspect is delicately balanced. Yet, given the events and celebration around the golden anniversary, fans would have expected this. In that regard, <cite>Skyfall</cite> succeeds as a Bond movie for fans of Bond movies; a thank-you letter to an audience that has helped the series remain successful for so long.</p>
                
                <p>There is also a sense that <cite>Skyfall</cite> offers a tiny course correction to the series. The 2006 reboot was brilliant and necessary, but a few aspects were missing. Not anymore. It will be interesting to see whether the new characters will work as well in subsequent movies, but given the back stories established here, I&#8217;m hopeful the series will remain contemporary while also true to Fleming&#8217;s original creation.</p>
                
                <p>One thing hasn&#8217;t returned to the old way of doing things though: the gun barrel sequence is again seen at the end of the movie, prior to the credits. For shame!</p>

                <p>Rebooted in 2006, and with its foundations now strengthened, I can&#8217;t wait for 007&#8217;s next assignment. Mendes has demonstrated that Bond can not only survive the stewardship of an established director, but be better for it. I&#8217;d love to see other British directors involved &#8211; where might Danny Boyle take Bond for example?</p>
                
                <p>The series may be fifty years old, but thanks to <cite>Skyfall</cite>, Bond is better looking and more dramatic than ever. Here&#8217;s to <cite>Bond 24</cite>.</p>
