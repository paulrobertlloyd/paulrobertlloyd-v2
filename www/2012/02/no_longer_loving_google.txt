Nelson Minar:

> I refuse to give in to a cynical view of Google's "Don't be evil" motto; that ethos was very real, a sincere and important guiding principle. And if a big company like Google can't avoid being evil, then what world-changing enterprise can? But I think Google as an organization has moved on; they're focussed now on market position, not making the world better. Which makes me sad.

> Google is too powerful, too arrogant, too entrenched to be worth our love. Let them defend themselves, I'd rather devote my emotional energy to the upstarts and startups. They deserve our passion.

Sound familiar? As much as [I despise Facebook][1], Google isn't any better behaved. In fact, its crimes are [often far worse][2].

I still have a Google account, although the only services I rely on are search and Reader. [DuckDuckGo][3] is looking like a promising replacement for search, but nearly every decent <abbr title="Really Simple Syndication">RSS</abbr> reader still syncs with Google Reader (even if through unofficial and undocumented <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr>s). As soon as that changes, my Google account will be deleted.
