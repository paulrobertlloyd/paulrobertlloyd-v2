Rian van der Merwe for A List Apart:

> A "shiny citadel" from far away, as [The Guardian once wrote][1], up close Bras�lia has "degraded into a violent, crime-ridden sprawl of cacophonous traffic jams. The real Brazil has spilled into its utopian vision."

> This problem echoes across today's web landscape as well, where the needs of ordinary users spill constantly into designers' utopian vision. All around us we see beautiful, empty monuments erected not for their users, but for the people who built them--and the VCs who are scouting them.

'Digital Bras�lias' is a great term for all the beautiful--yet ultimately useless--products emerging from the Valley. Product discovery can help us not only design things better, but design better things.
