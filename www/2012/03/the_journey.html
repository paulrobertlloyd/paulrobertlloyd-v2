            <div class="prose">
                <p>A new pair of jeans, the reignited love for a city and an inevitable answer to a surprisingly surprising question. Just some of the artefacts collected during two weeks in America.</p>
                
                <p>They all serve as a reminder that travel can be a means of reassessment and renewal; hopefully I&#8217;ve returned home a little wiser to the world than when I left it. That said, the notion of &#8216;home&#8217; continues to be a puzzle. Is home where the heart is? Is it possible to have multiple homes?</p>
                
                <h2>Wherever I Lay My Hat&#8230;</h2>
                
                <p>San Francisco was my home once, although I&#8217;ve seen more of this small city since I left than during the entire year I lived there. Parts of it scare me, parts of it disgust me. It&#8217;s messy, complex and incredibly diverse. It has its problems, not least the level of homelessness amongst an otherwise wealthy populous. I find this hard to ignore. Many seemingly don&#8217;t.</p>
                
                <p>Through the eyes of friends, I&#8217;m beginning to see a different image. The city is beautiful, it&#8217;s neighbourhoods even more so &#8211; it&#8217;s unlike any other city in the United States. Whether I could ever return to live there remains unknown, but the facts speak to how much I love visiting. Which of course makes it harder to ignore the inevitable; <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2006-04-05-sf-earthquake-cover_x.htm">a disaster is coming</a> and the only question is when. And that&#8217;s about as much as I want to think about <em>that</em>.</p>
                
                <h2>Lessons From the Road</h2>
                
                <p>Regardless, visiting California is like therapy. Maybe the optimism of friends provides an alternative take on life, one typically set against more pessimistic attitudes. And I like being optimistic, believe it or not. Before the trip is entirely relegated to history, here are a few lessons I picked up along the way:</p>
                
                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>It&#8217;s easy to generalise</strong> and America often suffers from this in the eyes of the world. When everything is bigger, it&#8217;s easier to focus on the extremes, but the greys are numerous and assorted. Also: designing for scale is a hard problem.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>People are complex</strong>. Dismissing people as inauthentic may be foolhardy without first knowing more about them. It&#8217;s easy to throw around terms like &#8216;douchebag&#8217;, but bravado can be compensating for a deeper insecurity. As <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/posts/3138-bruces-keynote-at-the-sxsw-music-festival">Bruce Springsteen said during his keynote</a> at SXSW:</p>
                
                <blockquote>
                  <p>Have iron-clad confidence, but doubt that keeps you awake and alert. It keeps you honest.</p>
                </blockquote></li>
                <li><p><strong>Every situation has differing perspectives</strong> but recognising that fact alone won&#8217;t necessarily mean you can see past your own. Assume nothing (except maybe success) and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon's_razor">never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity</a>. There&#8217;s a place for subtly, but more often than not, it pays to be obvious.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Make mistakes</strong>. It&#8217;s a popular truism, but experience matters. You can learn from mistakes, but never from regrets. Regrets can be hard to disown, but it&#8217;s unlikely you&#8217;ll remember the blunders. If beautiful, hopeful and well intentioned, you may end up smiling a bit if you do! And yes, as a post written more for my own benefit than yours, feel free to read between the lines here.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Don&#8217;t be a dick</strong>. Not so much a lesson, but previous experience meant I was able to follow my own advice, navigate a tricky situation and avoid a more painful form of embarrassment. Progress.</p></li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>The journey is the reward, and that journey continues.</p>
