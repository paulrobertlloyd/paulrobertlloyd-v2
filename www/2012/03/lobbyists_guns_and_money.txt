Paul Krugman:

  > We seem to be turning into a country where crony capitalism doesn't just waste taxpayer money but warps criminal justice, in which growing incarceration reflects not the need to protect law-abiding citizens but the profits corporations can reap from a larger prison population.

Scary yet unsurprising story about how organisations like the American Legislative Exchange Council (<abbr>ALEC</abbr>) are not only supporting, but writing wholesale legislation to benefit their corporate benefactors.

Of course, if it's happening in the <abbr title="United States">US</abbr>, it's happening here in Britain too. Indeed, I was reminded of [this fascinating article by Adam Curtis][1], which charts the rise of the political 'think tank':

  > If you go back and look at how they rose up--at who invented them and why--you discover they are not quite what they seem. That in reality they may have nothing to do with genuinely developing new ideas, but have  become a branch of the <abbr title="public relations">PR</abbr> industry whose aim is to do the very opposite--to endlessly prop up and reinforce today's accepted political wisdom.

Our political leaders are no longer interested in the concerns of the electorate and increasingly led by lobbyists--regardless of what destruction (societal, economic, environmental...) may result from their policy suggestions.

It surely can't carry on like this, can it?
