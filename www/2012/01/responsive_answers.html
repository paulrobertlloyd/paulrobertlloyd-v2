                <p>Back in October, <a href="http://ethanmarcotte.com/">Ethan Marcotte</a> asked me some questions about the design of my site. He was writing a round up of his <a href="http://www.netmagazine.com/features/ethan-marcottes-20-favourite-responsive-sites">twenty favourite responsive websites</a> for .net Magazine and wanted quotes from each creator. In the spirit of <a href="/2012/01/goals_for_2012/">blogging more</a> I thought I&#8217;d share my answers here.</p>
                
                <h3>Why did you choose a responsive approach?</h3>
                
                <p>My personal site has always been a place to try out new technology and techniques. As a site that is largely text based, I was also keen to take a content first approach.</p>
                
                <h3>Was there one especially tricky challenge that came out of adopting a responsive approach? If so, how did you solve it?</h3>
                
                <p>I think navigation is often a sticky point in responsive designs, and although my website is small, I was surprised that this still presented a challenge. The breakthrough came when I decided which sections of my site were less important. It turned out that I was already linking to these in the footer, meaning I could exclude them from the main navigation and only show them when there was enough room.</p>
                
                <h3>Did you learn anything from the site&#8217;s design you&#8217;d apply to future responsive projects?</h3>
                
                <p>In taking on a responsive project I quickly realised that resizing the browser window doesn&#8217;t give you a true feel for how a site will perform in the real world; input methods and bandwidth availability alter the experience as much as any viewport dimension. As I developed the site I &#8216;field tested&#8217; it when out and about; reading pages on the train or borrowing other peoples devices. This way I got to see how the site would appear in environments I don&#8217;t use myself.</p>
                
                <p>Whilst I tried to take a purely content driven approach, where the layout would adapt based on the constraints provided by the content, pragmatism took hold, and my breakpoints were soon adjusted. I found that I needed to strike a balance between what worked best for the content, and what worked best for different devices. I imagine my breakpoints will evolve as I continue to experience the site on different devices.</p>
                
                <p>I should also fess up; I started with a mostly desktop orientated design! Yet whenever I came across a tricky responsive design issue, I found refactoring my code to assume a linear &#8216;mobile first&#8217; layout forced me to question the relative importance of every element. The delete key became an important ally.</p>
