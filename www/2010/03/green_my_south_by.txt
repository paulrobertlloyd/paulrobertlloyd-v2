Once again, I feel the duty falls upon me to remind those attending this year's <abbr>SXSW</abbr> festival in Austin, that you really need not pick up that big, heavy, cumbersome and frankly useless bag of marketing junk.

Please take a moment to [read my thoughts about the <abbr>SXSW</abbr> 'Big Bag'][1] that I posted last year, and [download the poster][2] from the [a.green:focus blog][3] and add it to your own website.
