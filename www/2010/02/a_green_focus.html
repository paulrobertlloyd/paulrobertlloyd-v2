            <div class="prose">
                <p>As I reflected upon in <a href="/2010/01/2009_in_review/">my yearly review</a>, I made one substantial change in my behaviour, and a few smaller ones, that are hopefully reducing my carbon footprint. No longer relying on a car is something I can take a great deal of pride in, although I should confess that I still find driving desirable, especially since my discovery of the <a href="http://www.volvocars.com/uk/all-cars/volvo-c30/">Volvo C30</a>.</p>
                
                <p>Other small changes &#8211; switching off lights when they are not being used, reusing plastic containers when getting a take away, using a bag for life, turning off my computer overnight &#8211; might not make a substantial difference, but hopefully set an example to others.</p>
                
                <p>As such, I find myself criticising other people for making decisions that I don&#8217;t believe to be in the interests of sustainability. For example, the perceived need to own televisions of ever increasing size, which seems less about improving the viewing experience, more a wish to conform with this unfounded measure of success.</p>
                
                <p>A friend who brought their iPhone at the same time as me, recently upgraded &#8216;because they were told they could&#8217;. This perpetual upgrade cycle, driven by phone companies wishing to get customers onto new tariffs or contracts also frustrates me. I certainly have no plans to upgrade my device for the foreseeable future.</p>


                <h2>Undermined</h2>
                
                <p>Yet on many occasions, <a href="http://twitter.com/davidlwarner/status/7432026527/">friends have questioned such criticism</a>, especially given the amount of flying I&#8217;ve been doing over the last few years, which has not only countered other changes I&#8217;ve made but also undermined the example I&#8217;ve been trying to set.</p>
                
                <p>Having said that, I will staunchly defend the practice of travel. I think leaving the comfort zone of your surroundings, experiencing other cultures and seeing your own from a different perspective is to be encouraged. I believe my world view has fundamentally changed since the short time I lived in the <abbr title="United States">US</abbr>, and more recent travels around Europe.</p>
                
                <p>Prior to my move to California in 2006, I had flown only once, on a long haul return flight to Australia in 2003. Yet moving to America brought with it the obvious need to return home to see friends and family as often as possible, and flying quickly became second nature.</p>
                
                <p>However, thanks to <a href="http://dopplr.com/">Dopplr</a>&#8217;s ability to track the carbon generated from all these trips I&#8217;ve taken, you can see that since returning from America in 2007, there has been a year-on-year reduction of my footprint:</p>

                <p>Still, my friends are right; flying so often undermines my ability to advocate a greener lifestyle. It also dawned on me just how unpleasant the entire experience is anyway. Endless queuing, administration and <a href="/2010/01/lax/">frustration</a>, just to travel in pretty appalling conditions &#8211; I can&#8217;t think of any other situation in which waking up two strangers and crawling across a row of seats, just to visit the toilet would be tolerated, but it is here.</p>
                
                <h2>Changes</h2>
                
                <p>Contrast this with travel by train. Much of the queuing and waiting is gone, and you can travel from the centre of one city to another in a matter of hours. For just a little extra you can upgrade to first class, enjoy free wireless internet, sip champagne and eat freshly cooked meals. Whatever class you travel, the amazing scenery comes for free.</p>
                
                <p>Perhaps it&#8217;s no surprise then that I&#8217;ve opted for this form of travel lately, and I hope to undertake another rail bound journey around Europe later this year.</p>
                
                <p>However, I feel it&#8217;s important to make clear my statement of intent, and also honour the <a href="http://www.1010uk.org/">10:10 pledge</a> I&#8217;ve made to reduce my carbon footprint by 10% in 2010. So I&#8217;ve decided that <strong>this year I will not fly one single mile</strong>. Seeing as I returned from Australia on January 7th, this promise will hold true until that same date next year.</p>
                
                <p>I&#8217;m not saying this because I had no plans to fly either. I was really hoping to catch up with friends in San Francisco, and this years <a href="http://aneventapart.com/">An Event Apart</a> series looks especially enticing. Yet these can wait. There is of course the possibility I will be asked to fly by my employer (<a href="http://clearleft.com/">Clearleft</a> has many clients based overseas) yet I hope this is something I can avoid if at all possible.</p>
                
                <h2>a.green:focus</h2>
                
                <p>Hopefully, by improving my own behaviour and backing it up with firm action, I can once again advocate a green agenda. Indeed, after <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/paulrobertlloyd/announcing-agreenfocus">announcing my plans</a> to build a green coalition of web developers and designers last April, this month I formally launched the campaign. It&#8217;s called <a href="http://agreenfocus.org/">a.green:focus</a>.</p>
                
                <p>In my <a href="http://agreenfocus.paulrobertlloyd.com/post/371323289/">inaugural post</a> on the a.green:focus blog, I explained why our industry is best placed to challenge peoples behaviour and help them become more environmentally conscious:</p>
                
                <blockquote>
                  <p>Ours is an industry occupied by some of the most talented, creative and empathetic people on the planet. We craft interfaces that are easy to use, design experiences that push the boundaries of a medium and build websites that are accessible to all. We&#8217;ve developed social networks that allow us to communicate with each other in new and exciting ways. We are in the business of creating the future.</p>
                </blockquote>
                
                <p>To help launch the campaign, and with the help of my friends at the <a href="http://www.multipack.co.uk">Multipack</a>, I&#8217;ve organised a hack day, where we hope to build a website or application that will encourage people within our industry to think about how they can reduce their carbon footprint, quite relevant given the upcoming <abbr title="Southby Southwest">SXSW</abbr> festival in Austin, Texas. You can find more details about this event on the <a href="http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/5259221/">Upcoming page</a>, but needless to say <strong>it&#8217;s this Saturday!</strong></p>
                
                <p>Hopefully this is the first in a series of events and initiatives in support of the campaign, and so far the response from friends and peers has been incredibly encouraging. In the mean time, may I suggest you <a href="http://agreenfocus.paulrobertlloyd.com/rss">add the a.green:focus blog</a> to your preferred <abbr title="Really Simple Syndication">RSS</abbr> reader.</p>
