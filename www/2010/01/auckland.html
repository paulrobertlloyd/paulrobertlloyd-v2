                <p>The first stop on my quick sprint around New Zealand was Auckland, where I spent just a day and a half. This could have been considered longer than necessary &#8211; friends told me I should avoid it all together &#8211; yet I viewed this brief stop as an opportunity to acclimatise after a gruelling 24 hours of travel (and <a href="http://paulrobertlloyd.com/2010/01/lax">related interrogation</a>). </p>
                
                <p>Checking into a budget hostel, and a small dingy room decorated in various shades of brown (broken desk lamp, Johnny Cash playing loudly in the next room) adjustment was clearly needed.</p>
                
                <p>After unpacking and settling in, I ventured outside, intent on discovering the city. Before doing so, I took a moment to breathe in and survey my surroundings. In front of me, a small city park in the shadow of several sky-scrappers. The pulsating sound of pedestrian crossings were just about audible as was the hum of traffic from the nearby <abbr title="Central Business District">CBD</abbr>. Both accompanied by the indescribable smell of a place until now unencountered.</p>
                
                <p>It was at this point I remembered why I love to travel. Whilst photos and entries such as this become remnants of such trips, there is so much of the experience you can&#8217;t take back home. This, as well as knowing I had achieved something that was just an idea a few months beforehand, proved to be an enormous rush.</p>

                </figure>
                
                <p>The feeling of the familiar was the immediate impression I got of Auckland. Having visited many other &#8216;post-colonial&#8217; cities (Sydney, San Francisco, Montreal) there were many times I felt I could be in any one of those places.</p>
                
                <p>I walked through the Domain, around the harbour-side, climbed Mount Eden and explored the <abbr>CBD</abbr> (or Central Business District). With better planning I would have caught a ferry to see some of the outlying volcanic islands around Waitemata Harbour. Auckland&#8217;s signature building &#8211; The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_Tower">Sky Tower</a> &#8211; whilst impressive, lacked the views offered by the similar observation tower in Sydney, nor did it provide the level of excitement I found when I visited the Space Needle in <a href="http://paulrobertlloyd.com/2008/10/seattle">Seattle</a>.</p>
                
                <p>In fact, the same could be said of the entire city, and by Sunday afternoon I found myself in a local cinema. Luckily for Auckland, I chose to watch <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1130080/">The Informant!</a>, and soon realised I&#8217;d have been served better catching a ferry or visiting the War Memorial Museum. Lesson learnt.</p>
                
                <p>I&#8217;m probably being too harsh on Auckland, particularly as I remember feeling disappointed to be leaving early the next morning. However, for such a small city, it seemed intent on projecting an image of itself that is clearly larger than reality. I suspect this is due to it struggling to find a true identity, both within New Zealand (where it&#8217;s considered to be something of a show-off) and the wider region &#8211; it certainly didn&#8217;t feel like a city with the largest Polynesian population in the world.</p>
