My esteemed colleague, Cennydd Bowles:

  > Hover states can provide subtle visual cues that help the user understand how something works. A faint glow around a &#8220;favourite&#8221; star. An underline appearing underneath a link. But they should not be used for anything else. Hovering does not demonstrate user intent.
