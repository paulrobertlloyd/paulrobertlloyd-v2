            <div class="prose">
                <p>Earlier this week, Simon Collison revealed the first fruits of his newly established private entrepreneurship. &#8216;New Adventures In Web Design&#8217; is an affordable one-day conference landing in Nottingham on 20th January 2011.</p>
                
                <p><a href="http://newadventuresconf.com/">New Adventures</a> follows a growing trend for affordable one-day conferences and workshops appearing outside London, in parts of the country that have been poorly served by such events until now. This is a really positive development, and one I gladly endorse &#8211; I&#8217;d much rather see people travel to local events like this than fly 5000 miles across the Atlantic to attend <abbr title="Southby Southwest">SXSW<abbr>.</p>
                
                <p><a href="http://colly.com/">Simon</a> has obviously put a lot of time and effort into organising this event too. The website is a work of art, and the conference will be held in an equally <a href="http://newadventuresconf.com/location/">inspiring venue</a>; clearly fit for the <a href="http://newadventuresconf.com/speakers/">impressive lineup</a> of ten talented and insightful industry experts that will be speaking.</p>
                
                <h2>Only The Places Change</h2>
                
                <p>Unfortunately my immediate reaction on seeing this lineup was one of disappointment. Not because these aren&#8217;t great speakers &#8211; far from it &#8211; but this was confirmation of a long held suspicion that it&#8217;s the same faces appearing in different places. Indeed, three of these speakers will be appearing at this year&#8217;s dConstruct too.</p>
                
                <p>The reliance on the same set of 20 or so speakers is honestly starting to feel a little bit tired, dare I say &#8216;safe&#8217;. I believe there is a worthwhile discussion to be had on this subject, and as such this post shouldn&#8217;t be seen as criticism of the New Adventures conference alone. </p>
                
                <p>Maybe such criticism is unfair. Writing from the perspective of someone who has worked in the industry for six years, I&#8217;ve already seen these speakers many times over. For those just starting out, or finally able to attend such conferences thanks to lower pricing and locations outside London, they&#8217;re an excellent opportunity to see these people speak, and hopefully chat with them over beers afterwards.</p>
                
                <p>Yet I now find myself looking for more specialist content &#8211; <a href="http://www.thisisplayful.com/">Playful</a> in September and possibly <a href="http://www.thedesignofunderstanding.com/">The Design of Understanding</a> next January are sure to be highly thought provoking.</p>
                
                <p>As the speakers at these two conferences, and my enduring experience of <abbr>SXSW</abbr> would suggest, I&#8217;m starting to believe it&#8217;s with people <em>outside our community</em> from which I can gain the most insight, and help me to see my work in different ways (<a href="http://www.nowpublic.com/culture/nowpublic-sxsw2008-jane-mcgonigal-arg-designer-keynote">Jane McGonigal&#8217;s 2008 keynote</a> at <abbr>SXSW</abbr> stands out in this regard). Whilst I see many presentations refer to architecture, fine art, game and product design, I rarely see speakers from these specialisms talk at web design conferences. You could attend separate events, but it&#8217;s exciting to think what knowledge might be shared should different sectors of the design industry come together like this.</p>
                
                <h2>New Blood</h2>
                
                <p>It would also be nice to see some fresh blood appear at these events too, although I imagine one reason we&#8217;re seeing the same people speak is because others in the community are reluctant to do so. <a href="http://www.andybudd.com/archives/2010/02/clearleft_offer/">Andy Budd&#8217;s offer</a> of free training for budding conference speakers was notable for its lack of applicants.</p>
                
                <p>There are a few conferences that do seem to be aiming for varied, more experiemental lineups though:</p>
                
                <ul>
                <li><p><strong><a href="http://buildconf.com/">Build Conference</a>:</strong> Last years speakers included Ryan Sims and Wilson Miner, whilst this year sees Belfast welcome Frank Chimero, Tim Brown and Keegan Jones; people I&#8217;ve not seen appear at other conferences. The creation of a conference &#8216;fringe&#8217;, with workshops, lectures and even a pub quiz planned to coincide with the main event is also an excellent means of getting the local web community involved too.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong><a href="http://2010.dconstruct.org/">dConstruct</a>:</strong> (Excusing the obvious bias) I&#8217;ve not seen David McCandless, Samantha Warren, James Bridle or Marty Neumeier speak at many other conferences, whilst I believe John Gruber and Merlin Mann will be speaking in the UK for the first time.</p></li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>On a slightly smaller scale:</p>
                
                <ul>
                <li><p><strong><a href="http://speaktheweb.org/">Speak the Web</a>:</strong> A series of small, intimate, low cost events, these had the style of a gig and paired well known speakers with local developers who were either novices or who hadn&#8217;t spoken before.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong><a href="http://multipack.co.uk/presents/">Multipack Presents</a>:</strong> Perhaps to a lesser extent than others mentioned, but this series of talks has often seen local Birmingham designers and developers speak alongside Bruce Lawson and Stuart Langridge.</p></li>
                </ul>
                
                <h2>New Adventures in Content</h2>
                
                <p>Of course, there is a balance to be found, as for a successful event you need respected names to attract attendees. Yet I believe that even within these constraints &#8211; and as a few other conferences are proving &#8211; there is scope for more experimentation, both in terms of speakers and the content presented.</p>
                
                <p>Returning to New Adventures, where <a href="http://newadventuresconf.com/schedule/">the schedule</a> is still in progress, the site currently states:</p>
                
                <blockquote>
                  <p>We&#8217;re taking our time to carefully curate the event, working closely with the speakers to ensure we hit the right topics, and establish a strong narrative for the day</p>
                </blockquote>
                
                <p>With the 5-star lineup, this careful curation could very well mean New Adventures In Web Design is the must see conference for 2011, and I&#8217;m intrigued to see what presentations will feature. However it will be these rather than the speakers, that will determine whether I purchase a ticket or not.</p>

                <p><strong>Update:</strong> Since this article was published, <a href="http://colly.com/comments/new_adventures_in_web_design/">Simon has posted</a> some background information about the New Adventures conference, and also discusses the motives surrounding its creation. Certainly worth reading in the context of this article.</p>
