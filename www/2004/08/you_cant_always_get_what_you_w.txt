Now I have a slightly greater income (yet still many outstanding debts) my mind is busy creating a shopping list.

  * New mobile
  * New(er) car
  * PowerMac G5 and/or iPod
  * A bike

Meanwhile, OrangeVision in the midst of a big change (it would seem most people are this year)--this week sees the beginning of a move across the Woolworths car park to our newer and larger offices. Got to see them on Monday and very nice they are too. My opinion may be subject to change after spending this coming weekend painting it's walls...!
