Apple today announced a third generation iMac. Keeping to the all-in-one form factor, [this new revision][1] sees the <abbr title="Liquid crystal display">LCD</abbr> screen mounted alongside the G5 powered <abbr title="Central processing unit">CPU</abbr> and other hardware, mounted on one leg, reminiscent of the recently released Apple Cinema displays.

I can't help but notice similarities to the original Macintosh of 1984--well perhaps from the front, certainly not from its two inch side!
