As let downs go, this may be up there.

Having seen Super Troopers, a commendable film with some great and original comedy, I encouraged everyone towards this little publicised film, expecting to have discovered another comedic gem. Instead what we watched was as a horror movie, yet it's hard to know if it was intended to be a comedy too. It accomplished neither, falling somewhere in the middle and flat on its face.
