======================

On Sunday I felt the force of insanity and ran the 24th Bupa Great North Run, from Newcastle to South Shields. This year I decided upon a strategy for running the race (2 miles running/1 mile off) and together with a cool breeze and a following wind, I felt quite comfortable with the race not seeming to drag on as much as it did the previous year.

However the lack of heat meant a lack of sweat. Now when you've been drinking a lot of water, and continue to drink a lot of water along the route, if you ain't sweating it out--it has leave somewhere.  So the time I made up with my (slightly increased) fitness was soon lost with queuing for toilets, or more accurately queuing for a space behind a fence!!

So this year I'm quoting an unofficial time of around 2 hours 50 minutes. Poor, but then I only have myself and my lack of training to blame.

Unlike last year, this has actually made me feel more motivated to keep up a running program and actually **train** for next years run and achieve a good time that I know I can make.  Given this, I've decided my next event will be (pending getting an entry) the Great Manchester Run next May. At only 10<abbr title="kilometre">km</abbr>, this will push me into training earlier, and get my motivated even more. Well that's the plan.

As a footnote, I must yet again pay tribute to the people of the North East. Yet again, I was met by a friendly taxi driver, and the hotel I stayed in wasn't to shabby either. Along the route the people are what make it such a great day, especially the kids with their hands out and of course the bands too. It really is a marvellous event, and only in retrospect, do I realise how much I enjoy it. Here's to next year!
