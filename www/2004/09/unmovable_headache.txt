This blog continues to become more refined as I better understand the system that builds it, Movable Type. However, although very flexible, this amount of 'movement' can be a real pain sometimes. So far I've had problems with file permissions, calendar tags and category archive pages and I'm sure there will be more glitches to add to this list.

I'm sure the solutions are out there, I've found some of them, yet sadly none from within the systems hefty [documentation][1].
